# changes. EMRI direct: same table; EMRIs 0 (347 d) and 3 (256 d) plunge INSIDE
# the window and take the plunge path (fdot handoff + dense plunge chunk +
# 120 s stop taper, built alone, ~100-175 ms/row vs ~21 ms batched), validated
# on the laptop only -- watch "[EMRI_DIRECT] F fallbacks" = 0 and the
# every-10th cross-check. SOBBH lookup: same table, EVAL_DT 43200 holds
# (phase-tracer error is local), 0.036 s per 8-row call at 360 d (chunked
# 3.40 s). MBH batched: window knobs unchanged, decimation 2 safe for all 11,
# ~45 s per mbh_pe per rank (11 leaves). The exact SOBBH cross-check costs ~2x
# the 6mo one: put SOBBH_CHECK_LL_EVERY=10 on the line only if the 6mo run's
# first check stayed under ~10 % of its SOBBH leg when doubled.
#
# NOT carried (deliberately, "identical runs"): the 2026-09-08 1yr F-stat grid
# reduction (FSTAT_COMB_NSKY_MAX 256, FSTAT_N_ALPHA/N_SINDELTA 4) -- the 1yr v8
# 4-GPU script did not carry it either; revisit if the first F-stat fit's wall
# or dev0 memory says so. GALFOR_START_PARAMS stays the offline 3mo estimate
# (6mo ruling 2026-09-24 "just for now").
#
# LAUNCH (from the LAT root). Since 2026-10-07 (V9-30) the 6mo production
# line's knobs are the launcher DEFAULTS -- NGPUS=4, MIDIT_CHECKPOINT=0,
# MBH_NTEMPS=8, EMRI_NTEMPS=8, EMRI_TRAJ_WORKERS=8, MBH_WINDOW_DECIMATE=2, the
# gram / fisher eigen tables, the source cross-checks off -- so the line is:
#   ./scripts/fstat_proposal/submit_gf_1yr_v9.sh
# (a FRESH store: no CLOCK_START, no re-rung -- MBH_NTEMPS / EMRI_NTEMPS build
#  the 8-rung ladders the 6mo store was re-rung to. GB_FSTAT_FORCE_REFIT=1 /
#  GB_FSTAT_PE_REF=max stay one-off line knobs, never defaults.)
