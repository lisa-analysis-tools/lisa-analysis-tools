"""Clone a run store into a copy with ``factor`` x as many walkers.

Why this exists: the walker-block layout gives each rank ``B = nwalkers /
n_compute`` walkers, and several things are only measurable (or only
CORRECT) at ``B > 1`` -- above all the GB/VGB permuted tempering swap,
whose walker permutation is over ``arange(B)`` and is therefore the
identity at one walker per rank. Going from 4 walkers to 8 on the same 4
GPUs turns that back on. Starting the 8-walker run from scratch would
throw away the fitted noise, the VGB state, the F-stat epoch cache and
every GB leaf the search has found; this script carries all of it over by
DUPLICATING the walker axis instead.

What it does
------------
1. Copies the run directory (``gb_fstat_fit/``, ``warmstart/``, logs,
   truth npz, telemetry CSVs -- everything) to a new directory.
2. Rebuilds the ``*_testing.h5`` store with every walker axis tiled
   ``factor`` times, and updates the ``nwalkers`` attributes.
3. Leaves behind the sidecars that encode the OLD walker count.

What it deliberately does NOT regenerate: the F-stat epoch cache and the
warm-start components. Neither has a walker axis -- the epoch grids are
fitted against one reference walker's residual and the warm-start
components are a population model -- so both are carried over untouched,
which is the entire point of cloning rather than restarting.

The duplication is a DEGENERATE START, stated plainly
--------------------------------------------------
Walker ``w`` of the copy is a bit-for-bit clone of walker ``w % nwalkers``
of the source. The ensemble therefore begins with ``factor`` identical
copies of every state. That is harmless for MCMC validity (walkers are
exchangeable, and the chains separate on the first propose because every
(temp, walker) cell draws its own proposal), and it is irrelevant to a
TIMING measurement, which is what this script was written for. It is NOT
a fresh independent ensemble: do not read the first few iterations of the
copy as evidence about mixing.

``--mode tile`` (the default) lays the copies out so that each RANK holds
distinct states: with 8 walkers over 4 ranks the blocks are (0,1), (2,3),
(0,1), (2,3), so every rank has two different walkers to swap between
from the first iteration. ``--mode repeat`` gives (0,0), (1,1), (2,2),
(3,3) instead -- each rank holds one state twice, and its swap moves
nothing until the two diverge. Use ``tile`` unless you have a reason.

Walker axes are NOT inferred from the shape
-------------------------------------------
They cannot be. ``sub_backend/mbh`` has ``nleaves_max == nwalkers == 4``,
so ``mbh/chain`` at ``(nsteps, 2, 4, 4, 11)`` has two axes of length 4 and
only one of them is the walker axis. Every dataset is therefore matched
against a FULL expected shape signature built from its group's own
``ntemps`` / ``nwalkers`` / ``nleaves_max`` / ``ndim`` attributes, and
anything that matches no signature while still carrying an axis of length
``nwalkers`` is a REFUSAL, not a guess -- see ``plan_rescale``.

Usage (dry run first -- nothing is written without ``--apply``)::

    python scripts/fstat_proposal/rescale_store_walkers.py \
        /shared/data/global_fit_output/gf_prod_6mo_v8_4gpu \
        /shared/data/global_fit_output/gf_prod_6mo_v8_4gpu_8w --factor 2
    ... same command with --apply

Stop the job first: an open writer holds the store and h5py blocks rather
than erroring when it cannot take the lock.
