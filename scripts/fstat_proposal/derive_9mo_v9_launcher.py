"""Derive scripts/fstat_proposal/submit_gf_9mo_v9.sh from submit_gf_6mo_v9_4gpu.sh.

The 9-month run (user ruling 2026-10-07): the 1yr run's settings, exactly,
except what Tobs = 270 d itself changes. So the table below is the 1yr
table (derive_1yr_v9_launcher.py) with the Tobs-derived values at 270 d
and the 1yr values everywhere else (GB_NLEAVES_MAX, GB_N_SUBBANDS,
GB_RJ_INMODEL_CHUNK, the 6mo v9 parent for the warm start + noise pin).

Run from the LAT root after ANY edit to the 6mo script (with
derive_1yr_v9_launcher.py), then run
tests/test_submit_scripts_layout.py::NineMonthV9TwinTest (it holds the same
table and cross-checks every export against the 1yr script).

Every replacement is an exact string with an expected match count; anything
else in the file is byte-identical. Re-runnable."""

#          6480). GB_NLEAVES_MAX 20000, GB_N_SUBBANDS 4096 per GPU and
#          GB_RJ_INMODEL_CHUNK 16384 are the 1YR VALUES, verbatim (the
#          ruling), not re-derived for 270 d: all three are capacity /
#          memory knobs, and the 1yr sizing has more headroom at 9 mo
#          (slab ~0.75 MB/slot, sig-het stash product 4096 x 178 = 0.73e6
#          against the 6mo-safe 0.97e6).
#   9MO-3. MBHB_IDS: the catalogue MBHBs merging inside 270 d + 14 d
#          (2,5,7,12,16,18 -- all merge BEFORE the end; none lands in
#          (270, 284] d, the next are srcs 9 / 4 at 285.9 / 286.4 d) and
#          MBH_MERGER_TIME_BUFFER=1209600 (14 d, user rule 2026-10-07: keep
#          a merger up to two weeks past the end, modelled by its in-window
#          inspiral cut at the data end -- supported: the batched window
#          clamps its kept box at the data's active box and the stock
#          generator lives on the data lattice). EMRI_IDS / SOBHB_IDS
#          unchanged; EMRI 3 (plunge 256 d) takes the plunge path inside
#          this window, EMRI 0 (347 d) does not.
#   9MO-4. The MBH / EMRI / SOBBH preflight resolvers name the 9mo grid
#          (make_factory(1440, 6480); comments). The lookup tables are the
#          SAME canonical files (Nf and dt only), built once in the new
#          STORE_DIR on the first launch.
#   9MO-5. Warm start + noise pin parent = the 6mo v9 run, exactly as the
#          1yr (GF_SEED_STORE gf_prod_6mo_v9_4gpu/gf_prod_6mo_testing.h5,
#          GB_WARM_START_SOURCE_TOBS 15552000, refereed npz
#          gf_prod_6mo_v9_4gpu_refereed.npz -- auto-built from the parent
#          store on the first launch when missing). GB_WARM_START_LAST_K
#          10 -> 300 (user ruling 2026-10-08): the fit takes the last 300
#          written cold-chain rows x 4 walkers = 1,200 samples of the 6mo
#          full_pe (the 6mo itself took 10 rows x 10 walkers of the 3mo).
#   9MO-6. THE RECIPE (user ruling 2026-10-07, the SAME as the 1yr's 1YR-6;
#          not a Tobs change -- the running 6mo store's recipe is fixed, so
#          it lands in the 9mo/1yr only): gb_search_seed x3 -> gb_search_1 ->
#          gb_search_2 -> full_pe. GB_SEARCH_SEED_ITERS 5 -> 3;
#          GB_SEARCH_STAGES=1,2 (no gb_search_3); GB_SEARCH_1_SOURCE_EVERY=0
#          (no sobbh/mbh/emri moves in gb_search_1); GB_SEARCH_2_SOURCE_EVERY=1
#          (every iteration); GB_SEARCH_2_NOISE_MODE=cycle_end (ONE psd+galfor
#          search to convergence at the END of each gb_search_2 cycle);
#          GB_SEARCH_2_RESET_VALVES=1 (fresh entry: per-(walker, band) lnL max
#          re-learned + per-band barren valve revived); STAGE_REPLICA_PE 1 -> 0
#          ("No replica pe"). GALFOR_RATCHET stays 0 ("no ratcheting").
#          full_pe's declarations unchanged. `run_combined_staged.py
#          --print-recipe` under these exports prints the resolved recipe.
#   9MO-7. THE FIXED-DIM SOURCE SEED (user ruling 2026-10-08, the SAME as the
#          1yr's 1YR-7): the existing source_search stage runs, AFTER the seed
#          (main-session placement, same day): gb_search_seed x3 ->
#          source_search -> gb_search_1 -> gb_search_2 -> full_pe.
#          STAGE_SKIP_SOURCE_SEARCH 1 -> 0; SOURCE_SEARCH_POSITION=after_seed
#          (the sources' maxima found against a residual with the warm-started
#          galaxy already subtracted); sobbh_pe / mbh_pe / emri_pe ONLY at their
#          in-model repeats (25), from exact truth, psd + galfor FIXED at the
#          pin, GB leaves and VGBs held. Stop: every walker's cold lnL gains <=
#          SOURCE_SEARCH_TOL=10 nats over SOURCE_SEARCH_CHECKS=10 consecutive
#          rounds (the laggard walker decides), ceiling SOURCE_SEARCH_MAX_ROUNDS
#          =200; 10 rounds (MAXLOGL_ITERS_PER_STEP) per stored row. The globals
#          MAXLOGL_TOL=20 / NOISE_SEARCH_CHECKS=5 stay the cycle-end noise
#          slot's.
#   9MO-8. GALFOR FREQUENCY PRIOR (user ruling 2026-10-08, shared by the 9mo and
#          1yr), revised 2026-10-09: fk and f_2 0.8e-3..1e-2 Hz, f_1 1e-4..1e-2 Hz
#          (GALFOR_FK_PRIOR / GALFOR_F1_PRIOR / GALFOR_F2_PRIOR; stock: fk
#          0.8e-3..1e-2, f_1 / f_2 1e-5..1e-2). One resolver feeds the prior, the start-pin window
#          and the noise-pin refusal; the GALFOR_START_PARAMS pin is inside
#          the box. The 6mo relaunch keeps the stock box.
#   9MO-9. MOJITO_PSD_REFERENCE_FIT_UNEQUAL_ARM 0 -> 1 (2026-10-08): the reference
#          / 'truth' PSD pair is the unequal-arm fit on this fresh store (the
#          6mo's =0 pin only keeps its own resumable identity; the 3mo v9 dropped
#          it on 2026-09-26; ruling 2026-10-04: unequal arm only).
#
# EVERYTHING ELSE = the 1yr script = the 6mo script (NineMonthV9TwinTest
# diffs the resolved exports against submit_gf_1yr_v9.sh: only TOBS_TARGET,
# SIGHET_NT_LAYER, BASE_FILE_NAME, MBHB_IDS and MBH_MERGER_TIME_BUFFER may
# differ). The waveform knobs are the 1yr answers (no export changes): EMRI
# direct, SOBBH lookup (EVAL_DT 43200), MBH batched (decimation 2, 90 d
# window), EDGE_CROP_WAVELETS 60 -- verified at Nt 6480 (2026-10-07, by
# running the build guard): sig-het taper ceil(0.005 x 6480) = 33 + 8
# margin = 41 <= 60 (19 layers spare; the 1yr has 8), the data taper is 2
# fixed wavelets (auto crop 20, subsumed), EMRI pixel_edge 8 <= 60; the
# crop costs 1.85 % of the data.
#
# LAUNCH (from the LAT root; the V9-30 defaults ARE the production line --
# NGPUS=4, MIDIT_CHECKPOINT=0, MBH_NTEMPS=8, EMRI_NTEMPS=8,
# EMRI_TRAJ_WORKERS=8, MBH_WINDOW_DECIMATE=2, gram / fisher eigen tables,
# source cross-checks off):
#   ./scripts/fstat_proposal/submit_gf_9mo_v9.sh
# (a FRESH store: no CLOCK_START, no re-rung. Requires the 6mo v9 store for
#  the seed + warm start. GB_FSTAT_FORCE_REFIT=1 / GB_FSTAT_PE_REF=max stay
#  one-off line knobs, never defaults.)
