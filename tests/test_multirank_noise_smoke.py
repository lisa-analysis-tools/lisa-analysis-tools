"""PSD fan-out end to end: the noise_only synthetic fit on 2 compute ranks (fake comm).

Two arms:

* ``test_two_compute_ranks_run_the_noise_moves`` -- the historical one. Four
  walkers, two ranks, a 2-walker block each; unchanged.
* ``test_one_walker_two_replicas`` -- ONE walker on THREE ranks (head +
  compute + a dedicated saver), which is what puts ``build_layout`` in
  ONE-WALKER REPLICA mode: both compute ranks get block ``(0, 1)`` and hold
  the SAME walker's residual. The PSD family then runs its unchanged body on
  the head and scatters likelihood ROWS over the replicas through
  ``RowFanout`` (op ``psd_rows``), replaying the propose-begin prep and the
  end-of-propose noise publish on every rank (op ``psd_replay``). The inner
  proposal is the eigen-axis MH move -- at one walker there is no stretch
  complement -- which ``PSDMove._resolve_inner_kind`` picks and logs once.
  A size-2 world would NOT exercise any of this: ``resolve_roles`` aliases
  the saver onto the head below three ranks, so rank 1 would be the saver and
  there would be exactly one compute rank (no replicas at all).

        THREE ranks on purpose -- head, compute, saver. ``resolve_roles``
        aliases the saver onto the head below three ranks, so a size-2 world
        at one walker would demote rank 1 to the saver and leave a single
        compute rank: no replicas, no scatter, and every assertion below would
        pass vacuously through ``RowFanout``'s ``not self.active`` local-call
        branch. That is why the spy records ``active`` per call and the
        assertions demand a call with ``active=True``.

        The claims, in order of what a defect would break first:

        * the world does not RAISE -- a ``RemoteWorkerError`` on any rank is
          re-raised by ``FakeWorld.run`` as a ``RuntimeError`` carrying the
          remote traceback, so "it returned" is the no-error claim;
        * the PSD move really resolved its inner proposal to the eigen-axis
          move (the log line ``PSDMove._resolve_inner_kind`` emits once) --
          ``stretch`` has no complement at one walker and would have raised;
        * the replicas really DID work: at least one ``psd_rows`` scatter and
          at least one ``psd_replay`` broadcast, both with the fan-out ACTIVE,
          and the compute rank answered a non-zero number of commands;
        * the numbers are sane and SELF-CONSISTENT: the head's final cold row
          equals a fresh ``acs.likelihood()`` recompute on the head;
        * the eigen inner proposal actually MIXES -- every PSDMove's own
          in-model accepted count over the whole run is > 0, its eigen steps
          sit inside the prior box, and the move never hit the
          "All points entering likelihood have a log prior of minus inf"
          dead end. Mechanical success is not enough: before the
          2026-09-16 ``prior_box_widths`` fix every claim above passed while
