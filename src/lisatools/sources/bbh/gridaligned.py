class GridAlignedPhenomTHMTDIWaveform(PhenomTHMTDIWaveform):
    """:class:`PhenomTHMTDIWaveform` that evaluates on the DATA lattice.

    A drop-in replacement whose only difference from the stock class is the
    time grid it evaluates on. That difference is what makes a batch of
    independent parameter sets launchable at all.

    WHY THIS EXISTS
    ---------------
    ``pyResponseTDI`` shares ONE relative evaluation grid across a batch, so
    ``t0_shift_to_data`` -- the sub-sample offset between a source's own grid
    and the data grid -- must be identical for every row, and it refuses a
    batch whose offsets differ by more than 1e-12 s.

    Both parameters an MCMC walker actually moves break that:

    * ``t_merger`` is added straight onto the evaluation grid.
    * ``mT`` does too, less obviously: phentax builds its time grid BACKWARDS
      from ``tmax`` in geometric units, so the anchor moves by
      ``500 * MTSUN_SI`` ~ 2.5e-3 s per solar mass.

    So a walker batch was rejected outright. Evaluating every source on the
    data lattice makes each offset EXACTLY zero -- not merely inside the
    tolerance -- and the batch launches.

    The merger time is split into a lattice part and a sub-sample part. The
    grid carries the lattice part; the waveform is evaluated at
    ``t_arr - m_frac`` so the merger still lands at the requested time. The
    sub-sample part is spent inside the waveform rather than against the data
    grid, which is precisely what the response cannot absorb per-source.

    Set :attr:`grid_align` to False for stock behaviour in-process (that is
    how the A/B comparison is taken); the class is otherwise interchangeable.

        PARAMETER-INDEPENDENT BY CONSTRUCTION -- a function of ``data_t0``,
        ``dt``, ``tdi_buffer_time`` and ``T`` only, never of the batch. That is
        the whole point, for three measured reasons:

        * ``phentax._compute_strain_single`` is ``@jax.jit``. A batch-derived
          length recompiles XLA on every likelihood call: 3.2 s against 0.040 s
          cached, an 80x tax that would silently eat the batching win.
        * If the span depended on the batch, a row's column offset would depend
          on WHICH OTHER ROWS shared its call, and a walker's likelihood would
          change with batch membership -- fatal for detailed balance. On a fixed
          lattice each row's columns are a function of its own parameters alone,
          so composition invariance is structural rather than hoped for.
        * A union-of-rows span grows with the walker cloud (+43% samples for a
          one-day merger-time spread) and would need its own refusal path. This
          one never grows and never refuses.

        ``n_lead * dt >= tdi_buffer_time`` is required: it places the ``_lead``
        crop point (``data_t0 - tdi_buffer_time``) strictly inside the grid, so
        the crop lands at the same absolute time it does on the serial path and
        the leading zeroed region is identical.

        The span is the ANALYSIS window, ``domain_settings.N`` -- NOT phentax's
        generation window ``T``. The two differ, and sizing on ``T`` produces a
        grid longer than the data grid, which the FD transform rejects outright
        (``Signal length (262985) != target FFT length (197238)``). Sizing on
        the analysis window also makes ``_apply_response``'s ``start_ind`` crop
        remove exactly the lead margin and leave precisely the data grid.

        Plus a TAIL of :meth:`_tail_samples` past the data end, which the
        dispatch crops off again after the response (:meth:`_crop_tail`), so
        the output is still precisely the data grid. The response reads the
        strain up to ~500 s AHEAD of each output sample (the SSB ->
        spacecraft delay) and ``_apply_response`` zero-pads the strain after
        the lattice: for a source still inspiralling at the data end (a
        merger after it, e.g. a truncated epoch) a lattice stopping there is
        a strain STEP the stock waveform does not have, and the last few
        hundred seconds of output carry its response (measured on the
        windowed subclass: 2.1e3 x the local stock signal; mojito id 16

class WindowedGridAlignedMBHWaveform(GridAlignedPhenomTHMTDIWaveform):
    """Grid-aligned generation on a PER-LEAF window instead of the analysis window.

    The parent's shared lattice spans the whole analysis window
    (``domain_settings.N``) -- six months of samples for a source that lives
    for 90 days. The global fit sets a window around each leaf's merger
    (user ruling 2026-09-29: 90 days before to 10 days after, plus pads) and
    this class evaluates the batch on THAT lattice. Everything else -- the
    exact integer lattice, the split merger time, ``merger_time = 0`` handed
    to ``_apply_response`` -- is the parent's.

    ``set_window`` takes the ABSOLUTE segment start (a data-lattice time that
    is also a WDM layer boundary) and the segment's sample count; the lattice
    is prepended with ``n_lead`` samples so the invalid head lands outside
    the segment, where the placement clips it, and appended with
    ``tdi_buffer_time`` of tail so the response's forward read (the SSB ->
    spacecraft delay, <= ~500 s) sees the real strain at the segment end even
    when the source merges after it. Two heads are invalid:

    * the response's retarded reads reach up to ``tdi_buffer_time`` (600 s)
      before a sample, so the first ``tdi_buffer_time`` of output is
      warm-up;
    * ``_apply_response`` then ZEROS the first ``buffer_time / dt`` output
      samples of the lattice outright (``buffer_time`` defaults to 15000 s,
      ``MBH_PHENOM_DEFAULT_BUFFER_TIME``).

    The lead is therefore sized on ``max(tdi_buffer_time, buffer_time)``.
    Sizing it on ``tdi_buffer_time`` alone (610 s at dt = 10 s) let the
    zeroed head run ~14.4 ks INTO the segment, silently deleting any signal
    there. Generating without a window is refused: silently falling back
    to the analysis-window lattice is exactly the 6-month generation this
    class exists to avoid.

    Exception near the data start: the lead keeps the zeroed head outside the
    segment only while the lattice start lies after ``data_t0 -
    tdi_buffer_time``. For a segment starting within ~``buffer_time``
    (~4 h) of the run's ``data_t0`` (an edge-clamped window, see
    ``mbh_window_layers``), ``_apply_response``'s ``_lead`` crop re-bases
    the array start to ``data_t0 - tdi_buffer_time`` and the
    ``buffer_time`` zeroing then removes the first ~4 h of the segment. The
    stock path does exactly the same there (identical crop and zeroing), so
    windowed and stock templates still agree; those hours sit inside the
    data window's taper.
