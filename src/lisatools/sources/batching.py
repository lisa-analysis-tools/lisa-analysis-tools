"""Adapters that let a time-domain waveform generator drive a batched likelihood.

WHY AN ADAPTER IS NEEDED
    :meth:`~lisatools.sources.waveformbase.TDWaveformBase.__call__` returns a
    ``(signal, start_freqs)`` tuple -- the raw transform output -- which
    :class:`~lisatools.analysiscontainer.AnalysisContainer` cannot consume as a
    template. The sanctioned per-source conversion is
    ``_td_to_output_domain``, which :meth:`get_signals_for_residuals` already
    uses; it refuses a 2-D time array outright ("treat different sources
    separately").

    So a batch has to be split for the DOMAIN TRANSFORM even though it stays
    whole for the RESPONSE. That is the right split: one
    ``compute_tdi_channels`` call carries the whole batch through the
    expensive response evaluation, and only the per-source transform loops.

    ``__call__`` is deliberately left alone. Changing what it returns would
    alter every existing caller, and the point here is to add a capability,
    not to move the floor under working code.

    Each row's TD channels are placed on a segment of the data lattice that

    on a segment ``WDMSettings`` (same ``Nf``, ``dt``; ``Nt_seg`` layers), and

    the RUN's settings with ``active_slice_t = [n_start, n_start + Nt_keep)``,
    so containers slice their residual and PSD to it (``_slice_to_template``)
    and fills add it into the full residual (``add_signal``) -- the batched
    move first re-labels it onto the containers' own settings, whose ``t0``
    need not match these settings' (see ``t0_abs`` below). The template is
    zero at both segment ends (onset ramp inside the box; ringdown dead), so
    the periodic segment transform's wrap-around touches only the discarded
    pad layers -- measured on a toy grid: kept-layer relative error 1.2e-5 at
    8 pad layers, 9e-7 at 16 (tests/test_mbh_windowed_signal_gen.py).

        wdm_settings: the run's :class:`WDMSettings` (device-local). Only its
            GRID is used (``Nf``, ``Nt``, ``dt``, active box, window); its
            ``t0`` is not trusted as a time.
        nchannels: TDI channels the data carries (leading channels kept).
        tukey_alpha: the run's full-length data window alpha; the matching
            slice of that window multiplies the segment (0 -> none).
        t0_abs: ABSOLUTE time of layer 0 of the grid (the data start,
            ``general_info.data_t0``); the segment starts at ``t0_abs + s0 *
            layer_dt``. Defaults to ``wdm_settings.t0`` (read at

            start. A stock erebor build's settings do NOT (the WDM factory
            builds ``t0 = 0``; a GB comp build later sets it to the data start
            in place), so the global fit passes it explicitly.
        decimate: lattice decimation ``q`` (``MBH_WINDOW_DECIMATE``). The
            segment is sampled at ``q * dt`` and transformed on ``Nf / q``
            layers -- the same ``layer_dt``, hence the same pixels: for content

            told ``Nf / q * Nt_seg`` samples). ``Nf`` must be divisible by ``q``
            and the coarse grid must still hold the run's active band.
