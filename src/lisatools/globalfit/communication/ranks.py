"""Rank roles, walker-block layout, per-rank device pinning and seeds.

Roles: HEAD (rank 0: sequences the recipe, owns the full host state, AND
computes walker block 0), COMPUTE (one device list + one walker block each),
SAVER (highest rank, unchanged; aliased to the head below 3 ranks). The
mapping between ranks and GPUs is general in both directions:
``gpus_per_rank`` (a rank owns several devices, sharded in-process) and
``ranks_per_gpu`` (several ranks share one device); at most one exceeds 1.

``GF_LEGACY_RANK_LAYOUT=1`` restores today's roles (one compute rank owning
the whole pool, other non-saver ranks are stopped SPARE ranks).

``GF_GPU_ROUTING=1`` enables the unified GPU-count routing (see
:data:`GPU_ROUTING_ENV`). It is OPT-IN, so merging it changes nothing until
a run asks for it.

``mpi4py`` is imported lazily and only for real communicators.

    constructed inside ``fit.build()`` own private ``Generator``s that were

    This is the build-time analogue of :func:`derive_rank_seed`.

    DOMAIN SEPARATION. The run seed also feeds ``np.random.seed()`` /

    ``layout.describe()`` is the same full table on every rank (resolved by
    one collective allgather in ``build_layout``). Under real MPI each rank
    is its own process calling this once, so "every rank prints" falls out
    of SPMD execution; the head's copy prints unprefixed, and non-head ranks
    prefix theirs with ``rank_tag`` since this runs before ``GlobalFit``
    exists and installs ``prefix_stdout`` for the run proper. With
    ``comm=None`` (no rank to distinguish) the text is printed unprefixed.
