"""Top-level runner class (``GlobalFit``).

This module wires together the per-source samplers, the recipe driver, the
HDF backend, and MPI rank coordination into a runnable end-to-end global fit.

MPI rank roles (mirrors ``communication/ranks.py``'s docstring, which owns
the resolution: ``resolve_roles``/``build_layout``): HEAD (the main rank --
sequences the recipe, owns the full host ``GFState``, AND computes walker
block 0 like any other compute rank), COMPUTE (one device list and one
walker block each, running the ``ComputeService`` command loop), SAVER (the
highest non-head rank, at communicator size >= 3 only; below that the role
is aliased to the head and saves are synchronous). Every rank builds the
full pipeline; only the walker-block size of its ``AnalysisContainerArray``
differs. SPARE exists only under ``GF_LEGACY_RANK_LAYOUT=1``, which restores
the pre-port roles (one compute rank owning the whole per-node GPU pool,
every other non-saver rank built then stopped at startup without computing).

The legacy multi-stage pipeline classes (``GlobalFitSegment``,
``MPIControlGlobalFit``) were removed 2026-07 (parallel-resources plan P0).

    ranks). ``head_only``: every leaf that runs on the HEAD ALONE -- leaves
    that are not ``GlobalFitMove`` at all (plain eryn moves), ``FunctionMove``
    and anything that opts in via ``gf_head_only``. They are named in the
    warning rather than silently skipped: "head-only" is a real semantic
    change under multi-rank and the operator has to see which moves take it.

    "Head-only" means two DIFFERENT things, and the difference matters:

    * a ``FunctionMove``'s ``fn`` reads the head's ACA, which under the
      walker-block layout holds this rank's B rows only -- so it really does
      act on the head's walker block alone;
    * a plain eryn move gets the head's ``GFState``, which is the FULL
      ensemble (all N walkers). A zero-likelihood eryn move such as
      ``gb_ridge_gibbs`` / ``vgb_ridge_gibbs`` therefore acts on EVERY
      walker's coords and never touches an ACA at all.

    The one real caveat is the combination: a plain eryn move that DID call
    the likelihood would score all N walkers against the head's B-row ACA, so
    such a move must be ported to the fan-out before it is used here.

        (which it wraps)::

            gf = GlobalFit(curr)              # comm=None -> single process
            for model, state in gf.sample(iterations=100):
                ...   # inspect/mutate model.analysis_container_arr and state
                      # in place; the next iteration continues from them

        In-place mutation propagates because the yielded ``state`` is exactly
        the object fed to the next iteration. The recipe's stage-advance logic
        runs here each iteration (under ``run_mcmc`` the stopping function
        owns it), so multi-stage recipes behave identically; the loop ends
        when the recipe finishes or ``iterations`` is exhausted.

        Single-process only (``run_global_fit`` owns MPI): inside the loop you
        may do whatever you need — including your own MPI — as long as control
        returns synchronously.

        .. note::
           The backend saves each step *before* the yield, so an in-loop
           mutation is persisted with the *next* saved step; mutations after
           the final yield are not saved.

        Args:
            iterations: Iterations to run; ``None`` -> the configured
                ``general.num_iterations``.
            thin_by: Yield every ``thin_by``-th iteration (forwarded to the
                engine).
            progress: Show the engine's progress bar.
            store: Save steps to the HDF backend.
            sync_log_like: After each yield, re-sync ``state.log_like`` from
                the residual (``acs.likelihood()``) so in-loop residual
                mutations flow into the tempering/persistence bookkeeping. If
                you mutate ``coords`` in place, update ``state.log_prior``
                yourself.
