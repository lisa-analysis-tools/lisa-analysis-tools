"""Automatic warm-start component building (user ruling 2026-09-14).

The warm-start refit proposal (``rj_warm_search`` / ``rj_warm_pe``) needs a
REFEREED components npz built from the previous run's store by the three-step
pipeline fit -> referee -> apply. The 6mo campaign's first launch failed on
that npz being missing, so :func:`ensure_warm_start_components` runs the
pipeline automatically at recipe build when the npz is absent and
``GB_WARM_START_SOURCE_STORE`` names the source store.

The pipeline stages are INSTALLED sibling modules of this one
(:mod:`.fit_from_store`, :mod:`.match_referee`, :mod:`.referee_apply` --
user ruling 2026-09-14: "All the warmstart code should be part of the
globalfit/lisatools package"), and each step is a plain in-process python
call to that module's ``main(argv)`` (earlier ruling the same day: "python
imports right? not like calling bash") -- no subprocess, no interpreter
spawn, no script files.

MPI-safe by a lock DIRECTORY next to the target: ``run_combined_staged.py``
builds on every rank before roles resolve, so one rank wins ``os.mkdir`` on
the lock and builds while the others poll for the npz. A crashed builder
releases the lock in ``finally``; a lock left behind by a killed process is
taken over once it is older than the timeout.

Env knobs (read here, not Settings fields -- they configure a one-shot
offline build, not the sampler): ``GB_WARM_START_SOURCE_STORE`` (the
previous run's FULL FINAL h5 -- never a make_snapshots extract),
``GB_WARM_START_LAST_K`` (default 10), ``GB_WARM_START_SOURCE_TOBS`` (the
SOURCE store's Tobs, default 7776000.0 = 3 months -- NOT this run's Tobs;
``WarmStartComponents.from_npz(new_tobs=...)`` does the rescale at load),
``GB_WARM_START_BUILD_TIMEOUT`` (seconds a waiting rank polls, default 7200).
