"""Source warm start: MBH / EMRI / SOBBH leaves from a previous run's cold chain.

USER REQUEST 2026-10-08, for the 9mo / 1yr production runs:

    *"start the 9mo sources from the 6mo cold chain's final positions instead
    of catalogue truth ... let's do this for any source over SNR 10 at 6 mo.
    Otherwise start how we did at 6mo for sources under SNR 10 (computed at
    six months)"*

WHAT IS READ. The seed store's per-branch sub-backend group
``global_fit/sub_backend/<branch>`` at its LAST WRITTEN row (the main group's
``iteration`` attr minus one):

* ``chain`` ``(ntemps, nwalkers, nleaves, ndim)`` -- the branch's whole
  per-leaf ladder (MBH / EMRI / SOBBH are :class:`~lisatools.globalfit.state.
  PerLeafLadderState` sub-states: one rung count for the branch, one
  ``betas_all`` row per leaf);
* ``inds`` -- must be True on the cold rung (these are fixed-leaf branches;
  an all-False row is a row the saver has not written yet, see below);
* ``h_h`` ``(nwalkers, nleaves)`` -- the per-leaf COLD-CHAIN ``<h|h>`` the
  add/remove moves record at the end of every leaf visit
  (``_record_leaf_inner_products``; no rung axis). It is gated by
  ``{BRANCH}_RECORD_DH``: OFF on the slow container path, ON for the
  fast-kernel moves production runs (``MBHBatchedLikeMove``,
  ``EMRIDirectLikeMove``, ``SOBBHChunkedLikeMove`` which also serves
  ``SOBBH_LIKELIHOOD=lookup``). Off -> the stored record is NaN.

SNR. ``sqrt(h_h)`` of a cold walker is the optimal SNR of that walker's
template in the seed run's data under that walker's noise model. A leaf's
seed SNR is the MEDIAN over cold walkers: the decision is per SOURCE (all
walkers of a leaf start the same way, so the walkers cannot vote
individually), and the median is the posterior-typical value, immune to
one stuck walker. A leaf whose record is non-finite on ANY walker has an
UNKNOWN SNR: refused by default (``SOURCE_WARM_START_SNR_UNKNOWN``).

LEAF IDENTITY. Stored leaves are the seed run's catalogue injections in
SORTED catalogue-id order (``prepare_*_branch``: ``sorted(cat.keys())``,
merger-window filtered for MBH). The store does NOT record the id list, so
it comes from ``{BRANCH}_SOURCE_WARM_START_IDS`` (the seed run's
``MBHB_IDS`` / ``EMRI_IDS`` / ``SOBHB_IDS``, any order; sorted here). The
new run's leaf ids are ``injection_ids`` (recorded by ``prepare_*_branch``).
Leaves map BY CATALOGUE ID, never by leaf index; a new-run id the store
does not hold starts at the injection.

PLACEMENT. Walker ``w`` <- seed walker ``w`` (cycled ``w % n_seed`` with a
warning when the counts differ). When this run's branch ladder has the
seed's rung count the whole ladder is copied rung by rung; otherwise the
seed's cold positions go on every rung (what ``START_FACTOR=0`` does with
the injection). Every warm start is checked against THIS run's prior; a
point outside it refuses the launch. No random numbers are consumed.

Dry run on the cluster before launching::

    python -m lisatools.globalfit.warmstart.sources --store <6mo.h5> \\
        --branch mbh --ids 2,5,16,18
