"""Build the monitor page, and optionally the snapshot tar, in one command.

    python -m lisatools.globalfit.monitor [--snapshot] [--build-truth] \\
        RUN_DIR [OUT.html]

Two directions, two entry points:

* **here** -- a LIVE run directory -> page (and with ``--snapshot``, the
  tarball too). This is the cluster-side command.
* :mod:`lisatools.globalfit.monitor.from_tar` -- a downloaded tarball ->
  page. That one CONSUMES a tar; it does not make one.

BOTH ARTIFACTS LAND BESIDE THE RUN FOLDER (user ruling 2026-09-26), not
inside it::

    /data/gf_prod_6mo_v9_4gpu/                    <- the run
    /data/gf_prod_6mo_v9_4gpu_monitor.html        <- the page
    /data/gf_prod_6mo_v9_4gpu_snapshot.tar.gz     <- the tar

⚠ This REVERSES an earlier guarantee: the tar used to contain the page,
because the page was written inside the directory being archived. It no
longer does. Copy both if the report has to travel with the data.

``--short-page`` (2026-10-03) builds the SHORT page INSTEAD of the full
one: the topline, likelihood and leaf count over time, the phase-maximised
overlap and the current noise measurement, in well under a minute, written
to ``RUN_DIR_monitor_short.html`` beside the run folder (a separate file; the
full page's name is untouched). The user's request and the page's contents
are in ``_short.py``. It composes with ``--snapshot`` and ``--build-truth``,
not with ``--snapshot-only``. In-run equivalent: ``GF_MONITOR_PAGE_SHORT=1``.

``--build-truth`` generates the detectability truth set into the run
directory first. Anything after ``--`` goes straight to ``build_truth``
(``--catalogue``, ``--l1-brick``, ``--flo`` ...), though normally none of
it is needed: the mojito tree is resolved from ``MOJITO_INFO_PATH``, the
run's own settings, the legacy ``MOJITO_*`` vars or the standard
cluster/laptop paths, and handed to build_truth for both the catalogue
and the L1 orbit bricks.
