"""Installed monitor-page and snapshot production.

WHAT THIS IS (user ruling 2026-09-26): "containerize the html production
so it easily adjustable but build into the lisatools/globalfit package.
It does not have to be clean, we will fix it up later, but make sure it
reproduces the html as is done now."

**Reproduction is the hard requirement; tidiness is not.**
``_generator.py`` is ``scripts/diagnostics/gf_monitor_gen.py`` moved here
byte-for-byte -- 5908 lines, 431 top-level statements, 217 module-level
names, ``sys.argv`` read at import, ``raise SystemExit(0)`` if imported.
Turning it into a library is a real refactor (its 23 top-level helpers
close over those 217 globals) and is explicitly deferred.

What moving it buys, which is the part that was blocking: it SHIPS.
``wheel.packages = ["src/lisatools"]`` covers this directory, so a wheel
install has the generator and the saver rank no longer has to walk the
filesystem hunting for a ``scripts/`` directory that exists only in a
source checkout.

WHY EVERY PATH HERE SPAWNS A FRESH INTERPRETER
----------------------------------------------
Not for isolation (though it gives that too) -- for CORRECTNESS. The
generator sets its own dark-theme ``plt.rcParams`` near the top, and
~700 lines later imports ``lisatools...erebor.noise``, whose chain
reaches eryn, which calls ``plt.style.use(["science"])`` as an import
side effect. So in the original invocation the science style lands AFTER
the generator's block and wins.

Import this package and that order inverts: ``import lisatools`` already
pulls matplotlib, pyplot AND eryn (measured), so the style is applied
BEFORE the generator's block and the generator's block wins instead.
That is not hypothetical -- running it in-process changed the
"instrument noise posteriors" panel (25722 vs 27586 base64 chars, 25806
pixels across the whole plot area). Everything else on the page was
identical, which is exactly how a defect like this survives review.

A child interpreter running ``python <_generator.py> RUN_DIR OUT`` has
imported nothing, so the original order is restored and the page is
identical BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by inspection. The subprocess also
returns the build's ~2.5 GB peak RSS to the OS and keeps a matplotlib
segfault away from the caller -- on the saver rank, the run's only
writer, that second property is not optional either.

``build_truth.py`` came along unchanged and NOT renamed: the generator
locates it as a ``__file__`` sibling (``from build_truth import opt_snr``)
for column 2 of the #detect table. Renaming it would drop that column
behind a caught exception.

    ⚠ DOCSTRING CORRECTED 2026-09-27. This used to say the build happens
    "in a FRESH interpreter" and that the subprocess was "a correctness
    requirement, not a preference". That stopped being true when
    ``in_process`` became the default: the reason a child was needed was
    that importing ``lisatools`` pulls eryn's ``plt.style.use(["science"])``
    before the generator sets its own rcParams, which restyled exactly one
    panel. That is now handled by pinning ``font.size`` explicitly
    (``_NOISE_PANEL_FONT``), and both paths were measured byte-identical.
    ``in_process=False`` keeps the child as an escape hatch.

    Returns the path written, or ``None`` when ``check=False`` and the
    build failed.

    Published atomically: the child writes a temp beside the target and
    this renames it into place, so a browser refreshing the page never
    catches half a document.
