"""The after-save hook: page + snapshot on the saver rank, watched.

USER SPEC 2026-09-26: "[production of tar file and html] should occur
right after the file is saved, on the savers rank ... but should throw
major warnings if it is holding anything up."

WHAT "HOLDING ANYTHING UP" MEANS HERE, PRECISELY
------------------------------------------------
The saver rank is the run's ONLY writer, and the sampler's ``save_step``
is a BLOCKING pickled send to it. So while this hook is building a page,
the saver is not in ``recv``, and a sampler that reaches its next save
can block on the send until the build finishes. That is the failure this
watchdog exists to make impossible to miss -- it is invisible from the
sampler's own logs, which show only a slow iteration.

Three independent signals, all reported, because each one catches a
case the others do not:

1. **A save was already queued when we finished.** ``comm.iprobe`` after
   the build. This is the direct evidence that work waited on us.
2. **The build ate a large fraction of the save interval.** Measured
   against the observed gap between the last two saves, not a guess:
   the run's cadence is what it is. Above ``GF_MONITOR_WARN_FRAC``
   (default 0.25) it is reported even if nothing happened to be queued,
   because it means the next one probably will be.
3. **States were dropped.** The saver loop coalesces when its queue
   exceeds ``coalesce_threshold`` and warns; if the drop counter moved
   across our build, we caused it, and that is a DATA LOSS event
   (iterations that never reached the store) rather than a slowdown.

Signal 3 escalates to a banner and AUTO-DISABLES the hook for the rest
of the run. Losing stored iterations to a diagnostic is never a trade
worth making silently, and an operator who wants it back can restart
with a longer ``GF_MONITOR_ITER``.

Nothing here can raise into the saver loop.
