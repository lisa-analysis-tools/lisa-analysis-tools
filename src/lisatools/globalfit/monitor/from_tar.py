"""``snapshot.tar.gz`` -> monitor page, in one command.

    python -m lisatools.globalfit.monitor.from_tar SNAPSHOT.tar.gz [OUT.html]

This is the loop that was being done by hand on every snapshot: make a
scratch directory, untar, hunt for the run directory somewhere under
``shared/data/global_fit_output/<run>/``, then call the generator with
that path. Each step is easy and each one is easy to get subtly wrong --
pointing the generator at the tar's ROOT, for instance, renders a page
with every panel missing and no error.

Defaults chosen so the common case is zero flags:

* the run directory is DISCOVERED (the deepest directory holding a
  ``*testing*.h5``), so the tar's internal layout does not matter;
* the output lands beside the tarball, named after the run, unless a
  second argument says otherwise;
* extraction goes to a scratch directory that is REUSED when it already
  holds the same tar (``--fresh`` forces a re-extract), because a 130 MB
  archive is slow to unpack and usually gets rendered more than once;
* the mojito tree is RESOLVED, not demanded -- from ``MOJITO_INFO_PATH``,
  the run's own settings inside the tar, the legacy ``MOJITO_*`` vars, or
  the standard cluster/laptop paths. Both things it feeds degrade
  SILENTLY, so the chosen tree is always printed and a failure to find
  one is warned before the slow work starts.

ONE PYTHON PROCESS. The page renders in THIS interpreter; ``--subprocess``
opts into a child if you would rather keep the ~2.5 GB peak and any
matplotlib fault out of it. Both produce byte-identical output -- see
``_generator.py``'s ``_NOISE_PANEL_FONT`` for the one rcParam that used to
make that untrue.
