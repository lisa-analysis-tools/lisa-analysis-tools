"""Snapshot tar production, importable from the installed package.

This is ``scripts/fstat_proposal/make_snapshots.sh`` expressed in Python
so the saver rank can build a snapshot without a source checkout, a shell,
or a ``cd`` to the repo root (the shell script does all three).

THE SHELL SCRIPT IS DELIBERATELY LEFT ALONE (user instruction 2026-09-26:
"try not to touch any other code"). So yes, there are two implementations
of this recipe for now. That is a known debt, written down here rather
than discovered later: if you change the exclusion list, change it in
BOTH, and the test ``SnapshotMatchesTheShellRecipeTest`` compares the two
so the pair cannot drift silently.

The recipe, unchanged:

  1. reduce the live store with :func:`._store_extract.extract` (the big
     per-iteration chains keep only the last ``keep`` rows, cold chains
     ``cold_keep``), writing ``<store>_extract.h5``;
  2. take every file in the run dir EXCEPT the full h5 stores, backups,
     dissect dumps, rendered diagnostics, the fstat grid payloads, the
     midit checkpoint, and any prior archive;
  3. above ``log_cap_mb`` replace the DEBUG run log with a grep-filtered
     full-history file plus a raw tail (it grows ~0.5 MB/iteration and is
     the one file that outgrows the budget);
  4. ``tar -czf <run_dir>_snapshot.tar.gz``.
