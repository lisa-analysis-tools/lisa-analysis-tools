"""GF run status page: <run_dir> -> one self-contained HTML file.

Reusable: point RUN_DIR at any unzipped gf_prod_* snapshot and rerun; the
artifact redeploys to the same URL. Sections degrade to labeled
placeholders when a snapshot lacks their inputs.

The page is a STATUS OBJECT for collaborators, not an engineering worklog.
Its spine is one frozen denominator -- the catalogue galactic binaries
detectable (optimal SNR > 7) over the analysed GB band under this run's own
fitted noise -- against which completeness, purity and per-source recovery are
all quoted. The band is not hardcoded here: it is read from the ``band`` field
the truth npz stamps (``build_truth.py``), so widening the truth set to the
full 0.5556-21.94 mHz GB band re-labels every caption automatically. Run-mechanics forensics live in the collapsed appendix, never in the
body.

Optional inputs, read from the run directory or the working directory:
  gb_truth_3to21.npz  the frozen detectability set + full catalogue
                      parameters (built once by build_truth.py)
  kappa_grid.npz      SNR/amplitude ceiling per frequency, for the
                      sensitivity curve on the population panels
  gf_arm_<tag>.npz    written by THIS script on every run; holds one arm's
                      per-iteration recovery series so the v2/v3 comparison
                      panels can draw both arms.
Without them the recovery section degrades to a note; every other section
still builds.

COLOUR CONVENTION, one meaning per hue (the previous page used red for five
different things):
  cyan   injected data / the injected catalogue / arm v2
  amber  noise + foreground / arm v3
  green  recovered AND matched to an injection
  violet recovered with NO matching injection
  red    detectable but NOT recovered  (and nothing else)
  white  reference lines: noise model, y = x, sensitivity

# KEPT HERE, NOT IMPORTED FROM ._logs -- and that is load-bearing.
#
# The obvious tidy-up is `from lisatools.globalfit.monitor._logs import
# discover_run_logs`. It was tried (2026-09-26) and it CHANGED THE PAGE.
# That import pulls in lisatools.globalfit, whose chain reaches eryn,
# which calls plt.style.use(["science"]) as an import side effect. In the
# original file that happens at the `from ...erebor.noise import
# psd_truth_levels` line ~800, i.e. AFTER this file's own
# plt.rcParams.update() block -- so the science style wins. Importing the
# package up here moves it BEFORE that block, so the local style wins
# instead, and the "instrument noise posteriors" panel renders
# differently (measured: 25722 vs 27586 base64 chars, 25806 pixels
# changed across the whole plot area).
#
# So ._logs holds an identical copy for importers (the
# scripts/diagnostics/gf_monitor_gen.py shim has no body of its own), and
# MonitorLogsCopyIsInSyncTest compares the two sources so they cannot
# drift. A duplicate that a test pins beats an import that silently
# restyles the page.

# ---- POOLED SAMPLE WINDOWS (2026-08-27, user request) --------------------
# Every panel that SCATTERS per-leaf cold-chain samples used to draw ONE
# stored iteration -- the latest. A single iteration of a trans-dimensional
# branch is not a posterior, it is a snapshot of where the walkers happen to
# sit at one step: a source alive in 23 of the 24 cold walkers draws 23
# points, and their spread is walker scatter, not sampler uncertainty.
# Pooling the last few stored iterations makes each panel the thing the
# reader already believes they are looking at.
#
# Two windows, deliberately different:
#   * POOL_ITS_SAMPLES    -- scatter / explorer / marginal panels.
#   * POOL_ITS_POSTERIOR  -- corner plots, which need the extra rows before
#     their 2-D contours mean anything (this is the window the VGB and GB
#     corners already used; it is routed through the helper now so every
#     pooling site in the file reads from ONE place).
#
# THREE RULES, none of them optional:
#   1. min(requested, available) -- a store with three written rows pools
#      three, and nothing anywhere may assume the full window exists.
#   2. The alive mask is applied PER ITERATION. ``inds`` at iteration N says
#      nothing about N-4: the branch is trans-dimensional, a leaf alive now
#      may be dead then, and a dead row's coordinates are stale-or-zero
#      garbage that draws as a phantom source (f0 = 0 with the zero fill).
#   3. A reduced ``*_extract.h5`` store carries real coordinates ONLY inside
#      its final keep-window -- earlier rows are zero-filled placeholders
#      that survive as valid-looking arrays. Clamp the window to rows whose
#      coordinates are actually populated. (The full production store this
#      was validated on is NOT an extract, so the clamp is a no-op there;
#      it exists because the same generator is pointed at extracts.)

# hosts that HAVE scienceplots, but this one does not have it, so that call
# fails and the font is the whole story here.)
#
# That one number made the page depend on the caller's import history:
#
#   fresh interpreter -> this file sets font.size 10 far above, the import
#                        HERE raises it to 16, and the next figure renders
#                        at 16.
#   already imported  -> it was 16 before this file ran, this file's own
#                        block set it to 10, and the next figure renders
#                        at 10.
#
# One figure is drawn immediately below (the instrument-noise posteriors),
# so that panel alone came out different: 25722 vs 27586 base64 chars,
# 25806 pixels across the whole plot area, every other line of the page
# identical. It is why the page was reproducible only in a child process.
#
# Pinned to 16 because that is what every page produced to date rendered
# at, and reproduction is the requirement. It is NOT a considered choice
# of font size -- it is an inherited side effect, now stated. If the page
# should own its typography, change this to _BASE_FONT and expect every
# noise panel to change with it.

#     holds and is enforced against its OWN per-cell allowance. The 1-D
#     arrays the panels above read are max-over-walker mirrors, so they show
#     the ENVELOPE; the spread is only in the _w array, and whether the
#     spread ever opens at all is the whole question the feature poses.
#     Design: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-22-gb-cap-per-walker-design.md
#   * band_rj_shutoff_w    (GB_SEARCH_BAND_SHUTOFF_PER_WALKER)  -- a
#     (walker, band) pair whose cold-chain lnL converged WITHIN the current
#     recipe step takes no further RJ until the next step releases it.
#     "every OCCUPIED pair has shut off" is the stage-convergence criterion
#     (recipe.band_shutoff_w_pending_total == 0), so the pending count going
#     to zero is a stage ending, and the reset at the step boundary is the
#     next one starting.
#   * band_stage_w         (GB_SEARCH_STAGE_PER_WALKER)  -- stage 0 COARSE /

    # ======== FOREGROUND DIAGNOSIS: the whitened residual per GB band =========
    # User request 2026-10-02 (6mo job 675, after the first ratchet cycle
    # released and the foreground climbed back): "whitened (included
    # foreground) residuals to visualize any excess power left over ... could
    # the rigidity of the model have anything to do with somewhat averaging
    # over sub-bands with a non-smooth, generally non-gaussian residual?"
    #
    # Per GB band (the run's OWN band_edges, ~17 uHz at 6 months => ~270 FD
    # bins per band in X): u = |r_X(f)|^2 / (S_total(f) N dt <w^2> / 4) / 2 is
    # Exp(1) when the noise model is right, so the band MEAN sits at 1, the
    # band mean/median at 1/ln2 = 1.443 and the fraction of bins above 4.605
    # at 1%. A smooth drift of the mean away from 1 that follows frequency is
    # the 5-parameter tanh x power-law failing to follow the residual's shape
    # (model rigidity); a band whose mean is 1 but whose mean/median and tail
    # are high holds its power in a few loud bins (unresolved or missed lines),
    # not in a Gaussian floor. Every cold walker is whitened by ITS OWN noise
    # (the whitening its likelihood used); the two reference ratios whiten the
    # same residual by instrument-only and by instrument + the FittedHT
    # foreground estimate, so the reader sees what the fit added and what the
    # estimate would have said.

# ---- 8b. SEARCH EFFICIENCY: what each move COSTS against what it BUYS ----
# Added 2026-09-25 after job 628's first two full gb_search_1 cycles. The
# panel above answers "how long did this move take"; it cannot answer the
# question that actually decides whether the recipe is worth its wall time:
#
#   * cost per NEW LEAF, which is the number that degrades as the search
#     saturates. 628 went 5.5 s/leaf on iteration 1 to 70.6 s/leaf on
#     iteration 2 at an essentially FLAT per-iteration cost -- the
#     iteration timing alone shows none of that;
#   * the rj_step vs in-model-polish split inside each move. In 628 the
#     RJ proposals are ~10% of the GB wall and the convergence polish is
#     ~85%, so "the RJ schedule is expensive" was the wrong diagnosis;
#   * per-RJ-move YIELD. rj_replace cost ~1420 s/iteration and accepted
#     ZERO swaps in 122k proposals x 2 passes x 2 iterations. Nothing on
#     the page said so.
#
# Sources: the ``[GF_TIMING] ... move=<m> it=<k> wall_s=<w>`` records (per
# ITERATION, unlike the ``[GB_TIMING]`` ones above), ``[GB_TIMING <m> head
# r0]`` for the internal split, ``[GB_ACCEPT <m>] rj cold`` for the yield,
# and ``gb_counts`` for the leaf series. Every piece is optional: a run
# that predates any of them simply drops that subplot.

panel answers "is it doing anything" rather than "what is it set to".
<b>Left:</b> the share of occupied (walker, band) pairs that have shut off.
Since <code>GB_SEARCH_STAGE_END_ON_SHUTOFF</code> this IS the stage-end
criterion &mdash; 100% ends the recipe stage, so this curve is progress
toward the next stage, not just a diagnostic.
<b>Second:</b> the <code>[GB_CELL_LL]</code> sampled-vs-realized check, the
only instrument that catches a mis-credited cell ledger. The bar is the share
of unit reports over their temperature-scaled allowance and the annotation is
the count at the COLD rung, which is the half that reaches the catalogue.
&#9888; a high bar is NOT news by itself &mdash; it was already 98&ndash;100%
for the in-model and RJ moves before the all-rungs swap existed; what matters
is this moving relative to that baseline.
<b>Third:</b> vertical-swap acceptance per rung pair. It should rise smoothly
with temperature; a pair approaching 100% would mean empty&harr;empty pairs
leaked into the proposal set, which are accepted unconditionally and would
collapse that band's ladder.
<b>Right:</b> in-model repeats per provenance class against the floor
(window+1). A bar sitting ON its floor marker means the window is a fixed
budget those rows serve out rather than a measurement &mdash; the reason the
survivor window went 100&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;50.</div></div>

<p style="font-size:13px"><strong>The denominator, stated once.</strong> Every
recovery number on this page is against <strong>{SCI.get("ndet", 812)} galactic
binaries</strong> &mdash; those in the injected catalogue with optimal
signal-to-noise above 7 over {BAND_TXT}, the full band the sampler analyses,
evaluated under this run&rsquo;s own fitted noise. A model source counts as a
recovery when it lies within
{TOL_BINS:.0f} frequency bins ({TOL_BINS / SCI_TOBS * 1e6:.3f} &micro;Hz) of one,
one-to-one. Those windows cover {pct(SCI["chance"], 1) if SCI else "2.2%"} of the
band, so that is the rate at which an arbitrary source would match by accident.
Below roughly 3 mHz that threshold is an SNR statement and not a resolvability
one: the sensitivity it is measured against already carries the fitted galactic
foreground, but the catalogue puts many sources in every frequency bin down
there, so a binary can clear signal-to-noise 7 and still be inseparable from
its neighbours.</p>

saturates, and it moves even when the per-iteration cost is flat. Right: each RJ
move's wall time (cyan, left axis) beside the cold RJ accepts it actually landed
(green, right axis) on the latest iteration; a tall cyan bar over a zero green bar
is a move paying full price for nothing.</div></div>

<div class="caption">Inside each move: how much of its wall is the RJ step itself
versus the in-model convergence polish that follows it. The polish dominating every
row is the expected shape once the convergence rule is armed &mdash; it is what makes
"the RJ schedule got expensive" the wrong reading of a slow iteration.
&#9888; The wall column is PER ITERATION, the split columns are PER PROPOSE, taken
from the most recent <code>[GB_TIMING &lt;move&gt; head r0]</code> record. They agree
for a one-propose move; <code>rj_replace</code> runs TWO passes per iteration, so its

<div class="caption">{CAP_TXT} Left is the direct test of whether the cap is being
respected: bars at or above the cap are amber, and a bar past it would mean sources are
stacking. Middle is the race that matters &mdash; occupied cells must stay ahead of cells
at their cap, or the model is queuing against the ceiling rather than filling. Right
explains why the occupied fraction looks small: the cells tile the whole band uniformly
while the sources are concentrated in the galaxy, so most cells are empty because there is
nothing in them yet.</div></div>{PER_WALKER_PANELS}

with, and a noise-weighted inner product against the run&rsquo;s own fitted
instrument and foreground. Catalogue detectability is computed by bounding
signal-to-noise per unit amplitude over orientation, which can only over-include, then
evaluating exact SNRs for the survivors; an audit of 400 rejected sources weighted
toward the cut found a loudest SNR of 4.36 and none above 7. Overlaps and parameter
