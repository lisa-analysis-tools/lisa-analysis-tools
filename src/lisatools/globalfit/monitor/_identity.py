"""Run identity for the monitor pages: banner label, run kind and arm-cache tag.

The page generator (``_generator.py``, and its lean twin under
``scripts/diagnostics``) names the run it is drawing from the STORE DIRECTORY
name: the banner reads ``RUN_LABEL``, the per-run completeness curve is cached
as ``gf_arm_<ARM_TAG>.npz`` in the page directory, and every ``gf_arm_*.npz``
found there is overlaid as a comparison arm. A name the ladder does not
recognise used to fall through to ``("3-Month", "3mo")`` -> arm tag ``v2`` --
the WRONG banner and, worse, a silent overwrite of the shared ``gf_arm_v2.npz``
cache. That happened four times (1yr 2026-08-22, v7 08-26, v8 09-02, 3mo v9
09-28), each fixed by one more hard-coded branch.

2026-10-07 (the 9mo v9 run): the ladder lives here, every historical branch
kept VERBATIM (their arm caches already exist on the cluster pages, so their
tags must not move), plus ONE generic rule for anything else that carries a
``<N>mo_v<K>`` / ``<N>yr_v<K>`` token: ``gf_prod_9mo_v9`` -> ``("9-Month v9",
"9mo_v9")``, ``gf_prod_3mo_v9_2gpu`` -> ``("3-Month v9", "3mo_v9")``,
``gf_prod_1yr_v9`` -> ``("1-Year v9", "1yr_v9")``. The plain ``3mo`` / ``v2``
fall-through remains only for a name with no version token at all (the
original 3-month v2 run).
