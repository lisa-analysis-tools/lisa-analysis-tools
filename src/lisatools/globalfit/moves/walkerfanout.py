"""Whole-``propose`` fan-out over walker blocks (addremove family, PSD family).

Head: ``propose`` slices the FULL state into per-rank blocks, every compute rank
(the head included) runs the UNCHANGED body ``propose_local`` on its block
against its own ACA, the head merges the blocks back, SUM-reduces the per-ladder
swap tallies and adapts each ladder ONCE. With one compute rank ``propose`` is a
direct call of ``propose_local`` -- bit-identical to the pre-port code.

Semantics that change only when several compute ranks exist (design spec,
"Semantics that change only when n_compute > 1"):

* Eryn ladders adapt once per propose from the pooled swap ratio
  (sum accepted / sum proposed over ranks and repeats); ``tc.time`` advances once
  per propose instead of once per repeat. Ranks never adapt.
* The mid-iteration checkpoint granularity drops from per leaf to per propose.
* Eigen / info-matrix tables are rank-local proposal shapes; the sidecar is
  written by the head only.
* Stretch complements (PSD RedBlue splits) are the rank's local block.
* Cross-rank tempering swaps: none (within-rank); see the spec's WP8.
* Sub-state delta counters of the fanned-out branches equal the SUM over ranks
  of what the body wrote (the head's copy is zeroed first when the body assigns
  them, ``fanout_assigns_counters``).
* PSD search mode (``PSDMove.run_move_max_likelihood``) plateaus on the RANK's
  walker block maximum, so search termination is per block; pooling it would
  need an in-body collective across ranks (deferred).
* The pooled PSD ladder adaptation consumes ``PSDMove.run_move``'s explicit
  ``temperature_swaps`` tallies (the fancy, walker-permuting swaps included),
  where single mode adapts from the identity swaps ``temper_comps`` makes
  inside eryn's ``RedBlueMove.propose``. Both are valid acceptance ratios; the
  swap POPULATION feeding the ladder differs.
* ``move.temperature_control.swaps_accepted`` -- what eryn stores to HDF -- is
  the HEAD block's count, while the sub-state swap counters are pooled over
  ranks. Diagnostic only: nothing reads the control's copy back.

One-walker replica mode (``layout.replica_mode``): ``propose`` runs
``propose_local`` on the head with the full one-walker state; the moves'
scoring seams scatter rows through ``RowFanout``; ranks serve ``serve_<op>``
methods; none of the semantics above change because the body IS the
single-process body.
