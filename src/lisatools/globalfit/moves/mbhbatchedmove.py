"""MBH add/remove move scored by the batched, windowed grid-aligned likelihood.

The DEFAULT MBH scoring path of the stock erebor fits since 2026-09-30
(``MBH_LIKELIHOOD=auto`` resolves to it on every WDM, legacy-response run
without a conflicting ``MBH_WAVEFORM_DURATION``; see
``stock.erebor.source_runtime.resolve_mbh_batched_cfg``). ``MBH_LIKELIHOOD=full``
keeps the per-row container path. A data span shorter than the window
(3-month runs, the lite smokes) clamps the window to the data
(:func:`mbh_window_layers`) instead of refusing the build.

:class:`MBHBatchedLikeMove` keeps ALL of :class:`ResidualAddOneRemoveOneMove`'s
choreography (per-leaf expose/fold, in-model repeats, per-leaf tempering,
cold-chain bookkeeping) and swaps the scoring and fill paths, exactly as
:class:`SOBBHChunkedLikeMove` does for SOBBH:

* every chunk of ``batch_max_size`` rows is ONE batched ``compute_tdi_channels``
  launch on the leaf's shared lattice (the ``WindowedGridAlignedMBHWaveform``
  behind a ``MBHWindowedWDMSignalGen``), then a per-row segment WDM transform;
* every row is scored against ITS OWN container: the residual and the PSD are
  sliced to the template's box (``AnalysisContainer._slice_to_template``), so
  per-walker PSD samples are honoured;
* the convention bridge is the SOBBH one: ``compute_like`` returns
  ``offset[walker] + <r|h> - 1/2 <h|h>`` with ``offset = acs.likelihood()`` on
  the freshly exposed residual, which reproduces the container path's
  ``-1/2 <r-h|r-h>`` + noise term on every scoring site;
* the leaf window (kept WDM layers around the leaf's median cold-chain merger
  time) is fixed on expose/setup and locked for the visit; it is rebuilt only
  when the median leaves the margin band, and never on fold-back.
* times: the window is placed with the adapter's ``t0_abs`` (the ABSOLUTE
  time of WDM layer 0, ``general_info.data_t0``), never with a settings
  ``t0``; and every generated template is re-labelled onto a box cut from the
  CONTAINERS' own data settings before scoring and fill. A stock erebor build
  gives the containers ``t0 = 0`` (the WDM factory ignores ``times[0]``) and
  mutates ``general_info.domain_settings.t0`` to the data start when a GB
  comp is built, so neither settings ``t0`` is the data start in general.

A batch the response refuses (``BatchNotLaunchable``) or a domain error in the
chunk falls back to the per-row container path for that chunk, LOUDLY, and is
counted in ``n_batch_fallbacks``. ``MBH_BATCHED_FILL=0`` restores the dense
per-row expose/fold. The built-in fast-vs-slow check (``_verify_prev_logl``)
recomputes through the stock generator at matching convention with
``MBH_CHECK_LL_TOL`` (default 0.5 nats), gating on the COLD rung only (hot
rungs reported), every 10th visit unless ``MBH_CHECK_LL_EVERY`` is set.
Generation runs under both the cupy and the JAX device context of the
owning shard (phentax is JAX).

):
    """Kept-box and pad geometry, in WDM layers of ``wdm``, for a merger at ``t_merge_abs``.

    ``t0_abs`` is the ABSOLUTE time of layer 0 of ``wdm``'s grid (the data
    start, ``general_info.data_t0``); it defaults to ``wdm.t0`` for callers
    whose settings carry it. A stock erebor build's settings do NOT: the WDM
    factory builds ``t0 = 0`` and a GB comp build later sets it to the data
    start in place, so ``wdm.t0`` is 0 or ``data_t0`` depending on build
    order -- the batched move always passes ``t0_abs`` explicitly.

    Returns ``dict(n_start, Nt_keep, n_pad, n_pad_lo, n_pad_hi)``: kept layers
    ``[n_start, n_start + Nt_keep)`` cover ``[t - before - margin, t + after +
    margin]`` snapped OUTWARD to layer boundaries, clamped to the data's
    ACTIVE time box ``[ind_min_t, ind_max_t]``. The transform segment is
    ``[n_start - n_pad_lo, n_start + Nt_keep + n_pad_hi)``, always
    ``Nt_keep + 2 n_pad`` layers long, clamped to the grid ``[0, Nt)``:

    * interior: ``n_pad_lo = n_pad_hi = n_pad``;
    * near a grid edge the segment stops AT the edge, so that side's pad
      shrinks (to 0 when the box touches the edge) and the other side's pad
      grows by the same amount. The kept box still reaches the edge, so a
      merger in the first/last days of the data is covered. The segment
      transform's periodic wrap then touches the far end of the segment --
      pad, where the template is zero (onset inside the box) -- and the edge
      itself is tapered by the data window.

    ``Nt_keep`` and the segment length depend on the durations only (never on
    ``t_merge_abs``), so the shared lattice length -- and phentax's jit cache
    -- is constant across leaves, edges included. ``Nt_keep + 2 n_pad`` is
    made even (``WDMSettings`` needs an even layer count). The adapter's
    even-start parity rule then grows the low pad by one only for an odd
    interior start; a start clamped to layer 0 or to ``Nt - Nt_seg`` is
    already even.

    SHORT DATA SPANS (2026-09-30; a 3-month run, the lite smokes): when the
    configured window does not fit, it is CLAMPED instead of refused --
    ``Nt_keep = min(Nt_keep, active layers)`` and the segment ``min(Nt_keep +
    2 n_pad, Nt)`` (still even; an odd clamped ``Nt_keep`` gets the spare
    layer as pad), so the pads shrink to what fits on each side, possibly 0.
    A window that covers the whole active box AND the whole grid is the stock
    full-grid transform restricted to the active box. Logged once per
    geometry (``[MBH_BATCH]``, INFO). ``n_pad`` keeps the CONFIGURED pad; the
    actual pads are ``n_pad_lo`` / ``n_pad_hi``. Only a geometry with no
    valid segment raises: an empty active box, or a whole-grid segment on an
    odd-length grid.
