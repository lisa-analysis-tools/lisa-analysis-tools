"""SOBBH add/remove move scored by the chunked-heterodyne WDM likelihood.

:class:`SOBBHChunkedLikeMove` keeps ALL of :class:`ResidualAddOneRemoveOneMove`'s
choreography (per-leaf expose/fold, in-model repeats, per-leaf tempering,
cold-chain bookkeeping) and swaps ONLY the proposal-scoring path: instead of
one full-duration TD waveform + full TD->WDM transform per ``(temp, walker)``
row through the per-container Python loop, every batch is ONE vectorized
``SOBBHWDMComputations.get_ll_wdm`` call (BBHx ``sobbhcomps`` over LAT
``chunked_het``) directly against the ACA's live WDM residual buffers.

Convention bridge (load-bearing): the container path scores
``-1/2 (d_d + h_h - 2 d_h)`` [+ the per-walker noise term when the run fits a
psd branch], where ``d_d = <r|r>`` of the EXPOSED residual. The chunked call
returns only the source piece ``d_h - 1/2 h_h`` (comp built with ``d_d=0``),
so :meth:`setup_likelihood_here` captures the per-walker offset
``acs.likelihood()`` (= ``-1/2 d_d`` + noise term) on the freshly exposed
residual once per leaf and :meth:`compute_like` adds it back. This reproduces
the slow path's numbers on every scoring site (prev_logl, proposal batches,
fancy tempering swap) and keeps the base ``_verify_entry_vs_acs`` expose
invariant meaningful, up to chunked-heterodyne truncation error.

Residual expose/fold ALSO runs chunked since 2026-08-28
(:meth:`SOBBHChunkedLikeMove._apply_cold_chain_sources`): one batched
``fill_global_wdm`` per leaf visit in place of the base's dense
one-row-at-a-time pass, which cost 24 full TD waveform + TD->WDM builds to
expose a leaf and 24 more to fold it back (32 s per build on the 6-mo grid
-- the first leaf never finished inside a preemption window). This DOES put
chunked truncation into the residual, where the move previously kept the
residual bit-identical to the stock path and approximated only scoring; the
trade was measured first (6-mo removal-null: residual 6e-4 of ``<h|h>`` at
the ``Nt_sub=32`` defaults). ``SOBBH_CHUNKED_FILL=0`` restores the exact
dense pass. The built-in fast-vs-slow cross-check (``_verify_prev_logl``)
recomputes through the slow container path at MATCHING convention with a
tolerance knob ``SOBBH_CHECK_LL_TOL``.

        plus a full TD->WDM transform per walker -- with ONE batched
        ``fill_global_wdm`` call. Measured 2026-08-28 on the 6-mo probe: a
        dense SOBBH build is 32 s on this grid, so a 24-walker leaf visit
        paid 24 builds to expose and 24 to fold back; the first leaf never
        completed inside a 20-25 min preemption window.

        THE SIGN (vocabulary collides -- the numbers do not):
        ``apply_signal_from_params`` documents "+1 adds to the residual
        array, -1 subtracts", so the base calls ``sign=+1`` to EXPOSE a
        source (``r += h``) and ``sign=-1`` to fold it back (``r -= h``).
        ``fill_global_wdm`` accumulates ``factors * h`` into the same
        buffer and calls ``-1`` "remove" -- which is the move's *add_back*.
        Opposite words, identical arithmetic: ``factors = sign``.

        Rows whose template is zero -- non-finite, or ``f_low`` outside the
        comp's active band -- are dropped, mirroring the dense path's
        ``domain_error="skip"``. Skipping is deterministic in the coords,
        so a row skipped on the way out is skipped on the way back.

        ``fill_global_wdm`` is single-shard BY CONTRACT (it raises on a
        split holder), so a multi-GPU ACA is routed per shard with the same
        ``_shard_views``/``_partition`` primitives :meth:`_kernel_ll`
        already uses for scoring -- each view is a single-shard holder.

        ACCURACY: this puts chunked-heterodyne truncation into the RESIDUAL
        itself, where the stock move kept it bit-identical and approximated
        only the scoring. That trade was measured before it was taken (the
        6-mo removal-null sweep: residual 6e-4 of <h|h> at the Nt_sub=32
