"""Sidecar persistence for the per-leaf eigen proposal tables.

The ``(axes, sigmas)`` tables that
:meth:`~lisatools.globalfit.moves.addremovemove.ResidualAddOneRemoveOneMove.refresh_inner_move_tables`
feeds to the eryn :class:`~eryn.moves.EigenAxisMove` inner moves are
DERIVED products of an information matrix: minutes per leaf to build
(EMRI/MBH one Gram-form matrix per leaf; SOBBH a whole
``ntemps*nwalkers`` batch), kilobytes to store. Until this module they
lived only on the move object, so every process restart — the campaign
runs on a preemptible partition — repaid the full first-visit build for
every leaf of every branch.

This module writes the derived tables (plus the per-leaf visit counter
that drives the refresh cadence) to ONE pickle sidecar next to the run's
store, ``<store minus .h5>_eigen_tables.pkl``, in the spirit of the
mid-iteration checkpoint that sits in the same directory. Writes are
atomic (tmp + :func:`os.replace`) and a resume adopts an entry only when
the guards that would make the table the WRONG SHAPE or the wrong physics
agree: ``ndim``, ``ntemps``, ``nwalkers``, scope and — when both sides
know it — the data identity.

Staleness is deliberately tolerated. The expansion point an entry was
built at is recorded for diagnostics but is NOT a guard: the tables were
already frozen between refreshes (that freeze is what keeps the inner
move's ``factors == 0`` honest), and a frozen symmetric proposal is
correct Metropolis-Hastings whatever point its curvature came from —
a stale one adapts worse, nothing more. Persistence therefore changes
NOTHING about detailed balance; it only replaces recomputation at process
boundaries. The visit counter riding along means the normal cadence
refreshes an adopted table on schedule anyway.

Nothing here may ever break a run over its own cache: a missing,
truncated, corrupt or unreadable sidecar warns (once per path per reason)
and behaves exactly like an empty cache. ``EIGEN_TABLES_PERSIST=0``
restores the in-memory-only behavior.
