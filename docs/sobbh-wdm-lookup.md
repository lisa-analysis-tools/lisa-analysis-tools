# SOBBH direct-to-WDM lookup scorer: status and measurements

Branch `sobbh-wdm-lookup` (LAT). Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-30-sobbh-wdm-lookup-design.md`,
plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-30-sobbh-wdm-lookup.md`. The SOBBH twin of the EMRI
direct-to-WDM template (`docs/emri-direct-wdm.md`), vectorized over proposal rows and slotted into
`SOBBHChunkedLikeMove` as a comp.

## What exists

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| Vectorized n_ref table evaluator (quarter-turn rule, linear / Keys cubic) | `lisatools/wdm_lookup_eval.py` `WDMLookupEvaluator` |
| Batched 3.5PN, batched TDI-on-the-fly, tracer, sparse template, inner products, fill | `lisatools/sources/sobbh/wdm_direct.py` |
| The comp for the move / engine (`get_ll_wdm`, `fill_global_wdm`) | `SOBBHLookupComputations` (same file) |
| Stock knob | `SOBBH_LIKELIHOOD=lookup` + `SOBBH_LOOKUP_TABLE_PATH` (and `SOBBH_LOOKUP_{NUM_M_LAYERS,EVAL_DT,INTERP,ROW_BATCH}`) |
| Gate script | `scripts/sobbh/sobbh_lookup_gate.py` |

## The table

The n_ref table depends on the layer duration only: two tables with `layer_dt = 3600 s` built at
(Nf=64, dt=56.25) and (Nf=128, dt=28.125) agree entry by entry to 4e-9 (test
`TablePortabilityTest`). The laptop EMRI table `wdm_lookup_emri_cx_NF180_DT20_TL32_fd8x0p01_nld2.h5`
(layer 3600 s, offsets [-3, 3) layers, fdot +-8 layer units in steps of 0.01, 30 MB) therefore
serves the production grid (Nf=1440, dt=2.5). SOBBH chirp rates are tiny in layer units
(|fdot| <= 0.002 for catalogue-like sources; the 6-mo catalogue's worst chirper ~0.005), so
`num_m_layers=2` (5 layers per pixel) is *expected* to be converged by analogy with the EMRI
direct-to-WDM measurement (a chirp at fdot 0.25 layer units keeps ~1.3% of its power two layers
out; SOBBH's fdot is at most ~0.005, two orders of magnitude smaller) — this has not been
separately measured for SOBBH in this gate. No plunge chunk is needed; pixels past the fdot axis
(sources merging in band) are dropped and counted.

## Results (laptop CPU, EqualArmlengthOrbits, 2nd-generation TDI, scirdv1)

Both runs below are `scripts/sobbh/sobbh_lookup_gate.py --rows 8`, laptop table
`wdm_lookup_emri_cx_NF180_DT20_TL32_fd8x0p01_nld2.h5`, full printed output pasted verbatim (a
nanobind "leaked instances/types/functions" block printed by every run at interpreter shutdown is
omitted below — it is a known benign refcount-cleanup artifact at process exit, not a correctness
signal).

### What each column measures

- `mm` = flat `1 - Re(O)` per channel, no maximisation, computed on the **interior** pixels only
  (`EDGE=24` grid-end time pixels excluded on each side of the time axis, because the dense TD->WDM
  transform's grid-end pixels are unreliable edge artifacts, not a lookup defect).
- `ratio` = the norm ratio `sqrt(<h|h>/<truth|truth>)` on that same interior.
- `mm_w`, `dlogL`, `snr` = the scirdv1 XYZ noise-weighted mismatch / log-likelihood difference /
  SNR, computed over **all** pixels, including the dense transform's unreliable grid-end pixels.
- `mm_w_int` (new in this revision) = the same noise-weighted mismatch as `mm_w`, but with both
  `truth` and the lookup template zeroed outside `[EDGE, nt-EDGE)` first — i.e. `mm_w` restricted
  to the interior, added specifically to separate the two effects folded into `mm_w`. Measured
  (from `docs/sobbh_lookup_gate.jsonl`): in every one of the 12 source-rows below, `mm_w_int` is
  within about an order of magnitude of the interior flat `mm` (same pixels, same order), while
  the all-pixel `mm_w` is `69x`-`20,700x` above `mm_w_int` (about 1.8-4.3 orders of magnitude).
  This shows the `mm`-vs-`mm_w` gap is driven almost entirely by the dense TD->WDM transform's own
  unreliable grid-end pixels (present in `mm_w`, excluded from both `mm` and `mm_w_int`), not by
  an interior lookup-vs-truth defect.
- In the timing block, `exact` is the dense TD->WDM transform of the lookup's **own** batched
  response (not the production `SOBBHTDIonFly`, not an independent ground truth) — so
  `lookup_vs_exact_max_abs` isolates the lookup table / sparse-template approximation error
  specifically, while `chunked_vs_exact_max_abs` contains **all** of the chunked comp's
  approximations at once (the `m_band_half_width=3` band truncation, its `Nt_sub`/`N_sparse`
  chunking, and its own edge handling). How much of the chunked number comes from band truncation
  alone versus its other approximations is **unmeasured** by this script.
- Timing keys: `*_warm` is the FIRST call on the batch (includes any one-time setup/caching); the
  unsuffixed key (e.g. `lookup_get_ll`) is the SECOND call on the same batch. Both are single
  wall-clock samples, CPU-only, not medians. The two comps are not scoring an identical band: the
  lookup comp's band is `num_m_layers=2` -> 5 layers per pixel, the chunked comp's is
  `m_band_half_width=3` -> 7 layers. By the time the timing block runs, the lookup comp's `direct`
  object has already been exercised by the six `dense()` calls above, while the chunked comp
  (`ch`) is freshly constructed — so the two comps' `_warm`/unsuffixed pairs are not a clean
  apples-to-apples cold-start comparison between the two comps.

`dropped_pixels == 0` and `merged_rows == 0` for every one of the 6 sources (checked against
`docs/sobbh_lookup_gate.jsonl`). All per-channel `mm` <= 2.28e-6 (well under the 1e-3 gate); all
norm ratios within **1.03e-4** of 1 (recomputed directly from the JSONL: worst `|ratio-1| =
1.0279e-4`, src 2 channel Z; well under the 2e-3 gate). Source SNRs at this duration span
0.075-0.76 (see "SNR context" below). `lookup_vs_exact_max_abs` is 6.45e-5; `chunked_vs_exact_max_abs`
is 1.75e-4 — per the legend above, these are not a clean apples-to-apples split of the same error

`dropped_pixels == 0` and `merged_rows == 0` for every source again. All per-channel `mm` <= 4.0e-7;
all norm ratios within **1.44e-5** of 1 (recomputed from the JSONL: worst `|ratio-1| = 1.437e-5`).
The lookup comp's `get_ll_wdm` second call for 8 rows on the 6-month grid is 9.33 s vs the chunked
comp's 61.12 s (~6.5x faster at this `row_batch`/`Nt_sub` pairing, a single-sample wall-time ratio
on a shared laptop at these specific knob settings, not a controlled benchmark or an asymptotic
speed-up claim). `fill_global_wdm` for 8 rows is 10.60 s.

### SNR context

The six catalogue-like gate sources span SNR 0.075-1.53 across both durations (measured range
from `docs/sobbh_lookup_gate.jsonl`) for these masses/frequencies at Gpc-scale distances over
these windows. lnL errors and `dlogL` scale roughly as SNR^2 x mismatch, so the move-level anchor
measured separately in `test_sobbh_lookup_move` — lookup-vs-slow lnL max |diff| 0.081 at SNR^2 =
10.7 (SNR ~3.3) — is the measured anchor at a non-trivial SNR, well above the SNR ~0.1-1.5 sources
scored directly by this gate script. The two gate durations mainly differ in SNR, not in any
duration-dependent accuracy effect: going from 42.7 d to 6 months raises each source's integrated
SNR (more cycles observed within the window), and once an error is read relative to signal power
rather than as a raw lnL-unit number, both comps' agreement with `exact` improves rather than
degrades with the longer duration (the lookup's `lookup_vs_exact_max_abs` even decreases in raw
terms, 6.45e-5 -> 5.29e-5, despite the higher-SNR batch; the chunked number's raw growth,
1.75e-4 -> 8.29e-4, is 4.7x while SNR^2 grew ~15.7x; normalised by `h_h`, both comps improve from
42.7 d to 6 months).

### Measured in the test suite

- Table portability: two tables built at different (Nf, dt) but the same layer duration agree
  entry by entry to 4e-9 (`TablePortabilityTest`).
- Batched response vs production `SOBBHTDIonFly` per row/channel: mismatch ~1e-16 (machine
  precision) at `eval_dt = 600 s` — control: a one-day reference-epoch error gives 1.92
  (`BatchedTOFTest`).
- Lookup template vs the response's own dense TD->WDM, on the tiny `eps_freq=0.01` toy table:
  mismatch 1.4e-8..1.7e-4 per channel, norm ratios within 1.34e-4 of 1 — control without the
  quarter-turn parity rule: 0.50 (`DirectWDMTest`; per-channel numbers below).
- Move-level lookup-vs-slow lnL max |diff| 0.081 (median 0.021) at SNR^2 = 10.7, against the
  0.537 bound — control (no parity turn) 5.39 (`test_sobbh_lookup_move`).
- fdot mid-node error 0.108 on the coarse `eps_fdot=0.1` toy table, for the reference
  `get_wdm_coeffs` and the evaluator alike (table resolution: the production table has
  `eps_fdot=0.01` and SOBBH's `|fdot| <= 0.005` layer units sits in its first cell).
- The TDI-on-the-fly amplitude is **signed** (liveness is `amp != 0`, never `amp > 0`).
- The cubic-spline ringing past merger that the tracer masks measured 9e-23.

### Per-channel numbers, `test_sobbh_wdm_direct.py::DirectWDMTest::test_dense_matches_tof_own_transform`

The test itself only asserts (`mm < 1e-3`, `|ratio - 1| < 2e-3` per row/channel) and does not print;
the numbers below were obtained by re-running the test's exact `setUpClass`/body (same tiny table
from `build_tiny_table`, same `ROWS`, same `td_mismatch`) with a `print` added in a throwaway
driver script (no test or library file was modified):

```
row 0 ch 0: mm 1.378e-08 ratio 1.000001
row 0 ch 1: mm 1.362e-08 ratio 1.000000
row 0 ch 2: mm 1.400e-08 ratio 1.000000
row 1 ch 0: mm 3.118e-06 ratio 0.999949
row 1 ch 1: mm 6.496e-06 ratio 0.999947
row 1 ch 2: mm 2.614e-06 ratio 0.999926
row 2 ch 0: mm 1.647e-04 ratio 0.999884
row 2 ch 1: mm 1.639e-04 ratio 0.999866
row 2 ch 2: mm 1.722e-04 ratio 0.999908
last_stats: {'rows': 3, 'pixels': 256, 'lookup_pixels': 768, 'dropped_pixels': 0, 'merged_rows': 0}
worst mm = 1.722e-04; worst |ratio-1| = 1.341e-04
```

Range: mismatch `1.4e-8..1.7e-4` per row/channel, norm ratios within `1.34e-4` of 1 on this tiny
test table. This table is **not** a scaled-down version of the gate's production-layer table in a
"same accuracy, finer grid" sense — its `eps_freq=0.01` / `eps_fdot=0.1` node spacing is 2x
coarser in the offset axis (`eps_freq` 0.01 vs 0.005) and 10x in fdot (`eps_fdot` 0.1 vs 0.01)
than the production table's (see
the fdot mid-node-error fact above), so these numbers are a resolution-limited upper bound on this
toy table, not a smaller- or larger-scale version of the gate's own 42.7 d / 6-month measurement.

## Conventions pinned by tests

- Chunked-basis rows `(m1, m2, s1, s2, dist[pc], f_low, phi_c, inc, psi, lam, beta)`; the
  response feed is `phase = gw_phase + pi` with the intrinsic amplitude (`SOBBHTDIonFly`).
- Pixel centres `t_n = t_obs_start + n * layer_dt`, `n` the absolute grid index; the quarter-turn
  rule uses the absolute `(m + n)` parity.
- Inner products carry NO `4 * differential_component` factor (the chunked kernel convention);
  `-0.5 (h_h - 2 d_h)` is the container's source term.
- Batched response vs production `SOBBHTDIonFly` per row/channel: mismatch ~1e-16 (machine
  precision) at `eval_dt = 600 s` (`BatchedTOFTest`; the test's own assertion threshold is
  <= 1e-8, looser than what is actually measured); a one-day reference-epoch error is caught as a
  control (mismatch 1.92).

## Known limits

- Python, `xp`-vectorized (numpy / cupy); no C++/CUDA kernel yet (see follow-ups).
- A source merging inside the window keeps evaluating up to `tc` with the shared node grid
  (production `SOBBHTDIonFly` zeros the last `buffer_time` before merger instead); its pixels past
  the table's fdot axis are dropped (counted in `last_stats["dropped_pixels"]`, one warning per
  call).
- The lookup comp is SINGLE-DEVICE: the stock getter refuses a multi-GPU run (`ValueError`) and
  the comp raises when called off its build device; per-device replicas (the GB
  `_RoutedBandEngine` pattern) are a follow-up. Use `SOBBH_LIKELIHOOD=chunked` for multi-GPU
  walker shards.
- cubic interpolation is Keys cubic convolution, not scipy's global cubic spline.

## Follow-ups

1. **CUDA/C++ kernel** in the chunked-het family: per-pixel `SOBBHTDIonTheFly::get_tdi` amplitude /
   phase at the pixel centres, the table resident on the device, the same quarter-turn rule and
   the same `(d_h, h_h)` accumulation; this Python path is its reference. GPU leads per the sprint
   rule; the comp swap is then a comp swap, not a move change.
2. **CD1L data gate**: per-source mismatch / dlogL of the lookup template vs the mojito L1 SOBBH
   streams (ids 0-5 of the 6-mo run) on the production grid — the bricks are not on this laptop.
   Recipe: `L1ProcessingStep(source_types=["sobbh"], source_ids=dict(sobbh=[id]), orbits_class=L1Orbits,
   frame="icrs")` as `scripts/emri/emri_cd1l_campaign.py` does for EMRIs, the stock SOBBH wave wrap as
   the production template, `SOBBHDirectWDM.dense` as the fast one, report `1 - Re(O)` per channel,
   norm ratio, dlogL, SNR.
3. **Per-device replicas** of the lookup comp (table + orbits/tdi wraps per device, routed per
   shard as the GB `_RoutedBandEngine` does) to lift the single-device restriction.
4. JAX mirror; the fused phase-max quadrature; F-stat / gradient methods on the comp.

## One-GPU speed test (cluster runbook)

`scripts/sobbh/sobbh_lookup_speed_gpu.py` times the lookup comp and the chunked comp head to head
on ONE device at the production 6-month grid (Nf=1440, Nt=4320, dt=2.5): `get_ll_wdm` first call /
warm (median of `--repeats`; the lookup comp is already exercised by the setup fill, so its first
call is not a from-scratch cold start), the fill, the lookup's template/inner split (device-
synchronised spans, taken from the last timed call), the memory pool per comp (`lk_pool` /
`ch_pool` = pool total GB after that comp's calls, freed between the comps; the JSON also holds
the in-use figures) and the per-row lnL difference of the two comps on the same residual.
Device-synchronised timings. Each JSON line records the grid, `m_band`, `fill_band`,
`num_m_layers`, `nt_sub` and a timestamp.

    # cluster, one GPU, the stack's python, this branch checked out
    SOBBH_LOOKUP_TABLE_PATH=/path/to/wdm_lookup_emri_cx_NF180_DT20_TL32_fd8x0p01_nld2.h5 \

        --out sobbh_lookup_speed_gpu.jsonl

Reading the table: `ch/look` is warm chunked time over warm lookup time, so `ch/look < 1` means
the chunked comp was FASTER. Expect (a GPU EXPECTATION from the chunked kernel's one-block-per-row
launch, not a measurement) the chunked wall to be roughly flat in the batch size up to the
device's block capacity; the interesting columns are how `look_warm` scales with `rows` and the
`resp` (batched response) / `trac` (tracer) / `look` (lookup) vs `inner` (gathers + reductions)
split. `--row-batch` bounds
the response-spline memory (default 32); raise it on a large-memory device and watch the pool
columns. `resp`/`trac`/`look`/`inner` are not the warm median but the spans of the last timed call.

The run also printed, once, the response kernel's shared-memory warning:
`lisatools td_spline TDI-on-the-fly: N=25919, scratch=544299 B exceeds device dynamic-shared
ceiling (230256 B); global-memory scratch fallback (... slower)` — `N` is the per-row response
evaluation count, 6 months / `eval_dt` = 15552000 / 600 ≈ 25919 points, about 21 B of scratch per
point.

Reading:

- The lookup is 6-9x faster than the chunked comp at 4-32 rows and 1.5-2x at 96-288. The
  chunked wall is flat (1.7 s) up to 96 rows and doubles at 288 (its one-block-per-row launch
  exceeds one wave of blocks), as expected from the laptop memo.
- The lookup wall IS the batched response build: `resp` is > 90 % of `look_warm` at every size;
  tracer + lookup + inner together are <= 0.21 s even at 288 rows (so the table evaluation and the
  inner products are solved; the response is the remaining cost).
- `resp` scales per BATCH of `row_batch = 32` rows, ~0.25 s each (288 rows = 9 batches = 2.23 s).
  A linear fit of the 4/8/32-row points gives ~0.15 s fixed per batch (the `TDTDIonTheFly`
  construction: orbits / TDI wraps, input-spline setup, output-spline fit) plus ~3 ms per row
  (the kernel on 25919 points per row under the global-memory scratch fallback, and the per-row
  output-spline fits). Both parts are tunable without new code:
  - `--eval-dt 1800` (`SOBBH_LOOKUP_EVAL_DT=1800`): 8641 points per row, ~181 kB scratch,
    under the 230 kB shared-memory ceiling, 3x less kernel and spline work per row. Accuracy is
    unchanged: the laptop gate at `--nt 1024` reproduces every `eval_dt = 600` column (per-source
    `mm`, `ratio`, `mm_w_int`, `dlogL`) to 6-7 significant digits at `eval_dt = 1800` and 1200
    (`/tmp/gate_evaldt_1800.jsonl`, `/tmp/gate_evaldt_1200.jsonl` vs the 17:45 entries of
    `docs/sobbh_lookup_gate.jsonl`; e.g. source 0 `mm_w_int` 6.5914e-6 vs 6.5915e-6), and the
    6-month gate (`--nt 4320 --rows 4 --eval-dt 1800`, 33 s on the laptop) reproduces every
    printed digit of the 17:48 `eval_dt = 600` entries (all six sources: `mm`, `ratio`,
    `mm_w_int`, `dlogL`). The response splines vary on orbital and chirp timescales, far slower
    than 1800 s. The guard `eval_dt < buffer_time / 2 = 2500 s` is the hard ceiling at the
    default buffer.
  - A finer grid costs proportionally: Mike's `--eval-dt 300` run (51833 points, 1.09 MB scratch,
    same fallback) gave `look_warm` 0.338 / 0.479 s at 8 / 32 rows (`resp` 0.317 / 0.457) vs
    0.196 / 0.272 at 600 — both the per-batch and the per-row parts of `resp` scale with the
    point count. Its `max|dll|` (8.4e-4 / 2.8e-3) is NOT an accuracy comparison across runs: the
    script's residual is the lookup comp's own fill at that `eval_dt`, and its row batches come
    from one seeded RNG consumed in `--rows` order, so a different `--rows` list scores different
    rows. Only the gate (dense TD->WDM reference) measures `eval_dt` accuracy.
  - `--row-batch 96` or `288` (`SOBBH_LOOKUP_ROW_BATCH`): pays the ~0.15 s fixed cost 3x or 1x
    instead of 9x at 288 rows; the pool grows by the response output (N x 3 x n_eval x 16 B, ~0.1 GB
    at 288 rows and `eval_dt = 600`) and the sparse template (~50 MB), both small next to the
    2.7 GB pool.
  - Hoisting the per-batch `TDTDIonTheFly` construction (one generator per comp, padded to the
    batch size) removes the fixed cost; evaluating the response only at the pixel centres plus
    derivative points, or the CUDA lookup kernel (follow-up 1), removes `resp` almost entirely.
- `max|dll|` 8e-4 to 4e-3 between the two comps on the same residual: the chunked comp truncates
  at `m_band_half_width = 3` (`--m-band`) and the lookup uses its 5-layer window; the gate's
  move-level lookup-vs-exact numbers (above) are the accuracy statement, this column is only the
  two fast paths' mutual spread.
- Memory: 2.0-2.7 GB pool per comp, comparable between the two.
- `look_first` at 4-32 rows (1.1-1.3 s) is the cupy kernel-cache warm-up of the first call;
  irrelevant to a run.

Suggested next cluster runs (seconds each; `--no-chunked` skips the 1.7 s chunked calls):

    python scripts/sobbh/sobbh_lookup_speed_gpu.py --backend cuda13x --rows 8,32,96,288 --eval-dt 1800 --out speed_e1800_rb32.jsonl
    python scripts/sobbh/sobbh_lookup_speed_gpu.py --backend cuda13x --rows 8,32,96,288 --eval-dt 600 --row-batch 288 --no-chunked --out speed_e600_rb288.jsonl
    python scripts/sobbh/sobbh_lookup_speed_gpu.py --backend cuda13x --rows 8,32,96,288 --eval-dt 1800 --row-batch 288 --no-chunked --out speed_e1800_rb288.jsonl

The first keeps the chunked comp on so `max|dll|` confirms the coarser response grid on the
production grid; the warning line must be gone from its output.

Result of the first run (`--eval-dt 1800`, row batch 32; the shared-memory warning is gone):

Every size halves against `eval_dt = 600` (0.108 vs 0.196, 0.137 vs 0.272, 0.410 vs 0.816,
1.224 vs 2.438); the lookup is 12-16x faster than the chunked comp at 8-32 rows and 3-4x at
96-288. `resp` is now ~0.116 s per 32-row batch: ~0.08 s fixed per batch (generator
construction) + ~1.1 ms per row, so the fixed part is 70 % of it and `--row-batch 288` is the
next lever (expected ~0.4 s at 288 rows). `max|dll|` at 96 / 288 rows is identical to 4 digits
across `eval_dt` 600 / 1800 (3.531e-3 / 3.672e-3): the chunked-vs-lookup spread is the m-band
truncation, row-set independent once the batch samples the jitter densely, and the response grid
does not move the lookup lnL at that level.

Result of the second run (`--eval-dt 600 --row-batch 288 --no-chunked`; the `ch_*` columns are
`nan` and `ch_pool` is meaningless without the chunked comp):

    rows  look_first  look_warm     resp     trac     look    inner  look_fill  lk_pool

One batch instead of nine at 288 rows: 0.580 s vs 2.438 (4.2x); 96 rows 0.366 vs 0.816. The
marginal cost per row FALLS with the batch (3.1 ms/row from 8 to 32 rows, 1.25 from 32 to 96,
0.89 from 96 to 288): the response kernel is one block per row and the device is still filling
up, so the per-row part is sub-linear and the per-batch fixed part (~0.16 s at `eval_dt = 600`)
is what the batch size amortises. The price is memory: the pool grows ~23 MB per row at
`eval_dt = 600` (response outputs, their spline coefficients and the per-row intermediates all
scale with the point count), 7.7 GB at 288 rows in one batch vs 2.6 GB with batches of 32;
Pick `SOBBH_LOOKUP_ROW_BATCH` from the device memory, not from the speed alone (see the third
run for the memory split).

Result of the third run (`--eval-dt 1800 --row-batch 288 --no-chunked`):

    rows  look_first  look_warm     resp     trac     look    inner  look_fill  lk_pool

Against the chunked comp's 1.70 s (3.7 s at 288 rows) this is 15.7x / 12.6x / 9.3x / 9.6x at
8 / 32 / 96 / 288 rows, and 6.3x over the original `eval_dt = 600`, row batch 32 call at 288
rows (2.438 -> 0.389 s). What remains in `resp` is ~0.08 s of generator construction per call
plus ~0.85 ms per row; tracer + lookup + inner are 0.07 s at 288 rows.

Memory: the pool at 288 rows is 6.0 GB at `eval_dt = 1800` vs 7.7 GB at 600, so only ~1.7 GB of
the one-batch peak is the response's point-count-dependent part (~9 MB per row at 600, ~3 at
1800); the other ~5 GB (~17 MB per row, independent of `eval_dt`) is the lookup's own
temporaries: the Keys cubic 16-neighbour gathers over `(rows, 3 channels, 5 layers, 4320 pixels)`
for the cos and sin tables and the `(amp, phase, f, fdot)` tracer arrays. The cupy pool keeps
that peak. Lowering it is a code change (chunk `coeffs` over pixels or rows inside `sparse`, or
`interp="linear"` for a 4-neighbour gather at the linear-interpolation accuracy); until then the
budget is ~1 GB + ~20 MB per row in one batch at `eval_dt = 1800`.

### How sparse can the response grid go? (laptop gate sweep, 2026-10-01)

Mike's question: evaluate the response sparsely (as the EMRI direct path does) and spline up to
the pixel times. The lookup already never touches the data grid: it evaluates the batched
TDI-on-the-fly response every `eval_dt` and splines (amp, whole phase) to the pixel centres
(3600 s). The sweep below (6 months, `--nt 4320 --rows 4 --no-chunked`, `--buffer-time
2.5 * eval_dt + 5000` so the guard passes and the eval grid stays inside the node grid; the gate
script grew `--buffer-time` for it) reproduces EVERY printed digit of the `eval_dt = 600` baseline
for all six catalogue-like sources (`mm`, `ratio`, `mm_w_int`, `dlogL`) at eval_dt 1800, 3600,
7200, 21600, 43200 and 86400 s, i.e. one response point per DAY (181 points over 6 months
instead of 25919 at 600 s). The per-source lookup time on the laptop CPU fell 0.22 s (1800) ->
0.08 (21600) -> 0.06 (86400); the grid change is real. Why it works for SOBBH: the whole channel
phase is the slow PN carrier plus the orbital Doppler term (~1 rad/day at 20 mHz), both with
tiny fourth derivatives (cubic-spline error ~ h^4/384 * phi''''), so even 1-day nodes are
~1e-6 rad on these sources.

IMPLEMENTED (2026-10-02, `SOBBHBatchedTOF`, tests in `tests/test_sobbh_sparse_response.py`):

- `eval_grid(t_lo, t_hi)`: uniform `linspace`, at most `eval_dt` apart, at least 4 points,
  ending EXACTLY at the window ends (the old `t_lo + k * eval_dt` overshot `t_hi` by up to one
  step), after clipping the window `DELAY_MARGIN = 600 s` inside the orbit tables' coverage
  (`orbits.t_base`): the C++ response zeroes any time it cannot serve and a half-day spline
  across that zero edge rings back into the window (the EMRI session measured 2 % in amplitude
  two intervals in on a laptop-trimmed L1 table). A window entirely outside the coverage raises.
- The guard `eval_dt < buffer_time / 2` is gone; `buffer_time >= DELAY_MARGIN` is the condition
  (the node grid must cover the TDI delays), so the production buffer of 5000 s takes any step.
- Default `eval_dt` 600 -> 43200 s (12 h) everywhere: `SOBBHBatchedTOF`, `SOBBHDirectWDM`,
  `SOBBHLookupComputations`, `SOBBH_LOOKUP_EVAL_DT`, both scripts.
- The whole-phase spline is kept (no exact-carrier residual): for an in-band SOBBH the
  carrier is too slow to need it. Measured on the test grid (10.7 days, 23 nodes at 12 h), the
  worst pixel against the 600-s tracer is the chirpiest in-band row (60 + 55 Msun at 24.5 mHz,
  fdot 5e-10 Hz/s) at the grid's last pixels: 2.9e-6 rad, 6e-11 Hz, 1.8e-13 Hz/s, amplitude
  4e-9 relative; catalogue rows < 1e-7 rad. The error scales as the step to the fourth
  (6 h: 2.0e-7, 12 h: 2.9e-6, 24 h: 4.5e-5 rad), which is why 12 h and not 24 h is the default
  (the test asserts both the 1e-5 rad bound at 12 h and that 24 h exceeds it). A source merging
  inside the window leaves the band (f > 25 mHz) and the table's fdot axis long before the
  spline degrades: a 110 Msun pair at 25 mHz still has 0.57 yr to merger and fdot 5e-10, 12x
  under the production table's 6.2e-9 Hz/s axis. The EMRI form (exact analytic carrier at the
  pixels + splined residual, `sobbh_amp_phase_batch` gives the carrier at any t, and
  `LISATDIonTheFly::get_phase_ref` is the input phase at spacecraft-1 time so the residual is
  slow) remains the fallback if the band or the mass range ever grows; it would cost a host-side
  PN evaluation at every pixel on the GPU path.
- 6-month gate at the new default (`--nt 4320 --rows 4`, buffer 5000): every printed digit of
  the 600-s baseline again.
- Laptop CPU, `--laptop` preset (Nf=180, dt=20), lookup only, `--repeats 2`, before -> after:
  the 8-row 6-month `get_ll` was 9.3 s at 600 s (earlier in this doc), now 0.59 s. The response
  is 20 % of the CPU call; the numpy table gathers (`look`) are the rest and are milliseconds on
  the GPU.

  (`--nt 4320 / 8640 / 17280`; every span scales with the pixel count, as it should.)

Cost on the GPU after the sparse grid: the per-row part of `resp` (~0.85 ms per row at 1800 s)
scales with the point count (8641 -> 361 at 6 months), so it becomes negligible; the ~0.08 s
generator construction per call is then most of the response at <= 32 rows. The laptop stage
profile (`MBHTDIONFLY_TIMING=1`) shows the configured-orbits cache working (one 8-s
configuration per process, then hits), so that fixed cost is the kernel launch, the input-spline
build, the wraps and the output-spline fits; the cluster profile decides what to hoist. The
response part of the pool (~1.7 GB at 288 rows, 1800 s) shrinks ~25x; the lookup's own
temporaries (~17 MB per row) are untouched.

Cluster speed check at 6 / 12 / 24 months (one GPU, `SOBBH_LOOKUP_TABLE_PATH` exported as for
the earlier runs; the stage profile prints at exit):

(default `--eval-dt 43200`, `--row-batch 32`; the chunked comp runs too, so `ch/look` and
`max|dll|` come out per duration. The 24-month residual slab and `invC` are 4x the 6-month
ones, ~2.4 GB; the lookup's per-row temporaries scale with the pixel count, ~70 MB per row at
24 months, so `--row-batch 32` is the safe default there.)

- The sparse grid took the 8-row 6-month call from 0.194 to 0.051 s; the chunked comp scales
  with the duration (1.7 / 3.4 / 6.8 s at 8 rows), the lookup barely (0.051 / 0.053 / 0.059).
- Stage profile per response build: kernel 2.3 / 4.3 / 8.0 ms (6 / 12 / 24 months), output
  splines 2.5-3.7 ms, input splines 2.7 ms; the orbits line is ONE configuration amortised.
  The rest of the ~33-40 ms `resp` is outside those stages: the PN at the 2048 nodes, the
  uploads, Python -- the speed script now prints a `pn` column to split it.
- `resp` at 96 / 288 rows = 3 / 9 builds of the fixed cost (row batch 32): fixed below.
- `max|dll|` vs chunked 8e-4 .. 7e-3 (the chunked comp's m-band truncation, growing with the
  duration as its chunk count does); pools 2.0-4.5 GB.

### EMRI-style cost reductions (2026-10-02)

Following the EMRI direct-WDM session's path (sparse response, analytic derivatives, blocks,
one fused kernel; `plans/emri-wdm-fused-lookup-kernel.md`):

- Already in place for SOBBH: the sparse response grid, analytic spline derivatives (no
  finite-difference stencils), amplitude read at the pixel centres only, output in the active
  band only. The exact-carrier form is not needed in band (above).
- NEW: ONE response build per call for all rows; `row_batch` (`SOBBH_LOOKUP_ROW_BATCH`) now
  only blocks the tracer / lookup temporaries (`SOBBHDirectWDM.response` + `sparse_from(out,
  rows)`, `sobbh_tracer(..., rows=(lo, hi))` through the splines' `ind_interps`). Expected at
  288 rows / 6 months: `resp` 0.366 -> ~0.04-0.08 s, the call ~0.57 -> ~0.25 s.
  `tests/test_sobbh_lookup_batching.py` pins: one build per get_ll / fill, results independent
  of `row_batch` to 1e-12, the tracer's row range equals the full tracer's slice.
- NEW: `pn` span (the PN amplitude / phase at the node grid) in `last_call_spans` and the speed
  script. Laptop CPU (JAX CPU): 11 / 25 / 171 ms at 8 / 32 / 288 rows; on the cluster the next
  speed run shows it.
- NEW: the table interpolation is the table's own uniform cubic B-spline (`interp="spline"`,
  default everywhere; `SOBBH_LOOKUP_INTERP`): the fused kernels' semantics, and on the 6-month
  gate equal to or better than Keys (sources 3 / 5: mismatch 2.6e-7 / 7e-8 vs 4.0e-7 / 1.5e-7,
  integrated weighted 2.3e-7 / 8.3e-8 vs 3.5e-7 / 1.7e-7; the other four unchanged).
- PLANNED: the SOBBH fused lookup kernel (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-02-sobbh-fused-lookup-kernel.md`),
  response splines -> `(d_h, h_h)` per row (or the fill) in one launch, built on the EMRI
  session's shared device helpers once those are pushed.

### Fused lookup kernel (2026-10-02, night): built, CPU-tested, ready for the cluster

`src/lisatools/cutils/sobbh_lookup_kernel.{hpp,cu}` (`backend.sobbh_lookup`): one launch from
the response splines to `<d|h>`, `<h|h>` per row (scoring) or the fill, nothing per pixel in
global memory, on the EMRI session's shared helpers (`wdm_lookup_kernels.hh`: B-spline table,
quarter turn, spline derivatives). `SOBBH_LOOKUP_KERNEL` = `auto` (default: when the module has
it and `SOBBH_LOOKUP_INTERP=spline`), `kernel` (required) or `python`. Plan + results:
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-02-sobbh-fused-lookup-kernel.md`. Kernel == Python lookup to
1e-10 (scoring, routing, AET diagonal, fill, stats); four kernel mutations each caught. Laptop
CPU at 6 months, the lookup step 0.54 -> 0.09 s at 8 rows (the serial CPU build); on the GPU
the expectation is ~ms for the whole lookup at 288 rows, leaving the response build (`resp`,
with its `pn` part) as the call.

Cluster verification (mirrors the EMRI one: one unit-test line plus one speed/accuracy script):

    git pull origin dev
    pip install -e . --no-build-isolation          # REBUILDS the C++/CUDA modules (both kernels)
    export SOBBH_LOOKUP_TABLE_PATH=/path/you/built/wdm_lookup_sobbh_cx_NF1440_DT2p5_TL32_fd8x0p01_nld2.h5
    python -m unittest tests.test_sobbh_lookup_kernel tests.test_sobbh_lookup_batching tests.test_sobbh_sparse_response tests.test_sobbh_wdm_direct tests.test_wdm_lookup_eval -v
    bash scripts/sobbh/sobbh_speed_durations.sh

The unit line must show `test_gpu_equals_cpu ... ok` (a skip means the GPU module has no
`sobbh_lookup`: the rebuild did not take). `scripts/sobbh/sobbh_speed_durations.sh` (the twin of
`scripts/emri/emri_speed_durations.sh`; knobs BACKEND, DAYS "180 360 720", TABLE, ROWS, LOOKUPS
"kernel,python", REPS, GATE_ROWS, GATE, SPEED_ARGS, OUT) runs per duration (Nt = days * 24):
the speed script on the production grid once per lookup (the chunked comp alongside the first:
ch/look and max|dll|; the `MBHTDIONFLY_TIMING` stage profile), then the accuracy gate per lookup
(per-source mismatch / ratio / dlogL vs the dense transform, and `[gate] ... max|lnL lookup -
exact|` for the comp's scoring path). Logs and JSON lines in `sobbh_speed_durations_<date>/`.
With the kernel the speed table's `look` column is the fused kernel and `trac` / `inner` read 0;
the `[gate]` line must agree between `lookup=kernel` and `lookup=python` (same semantics; on the
laptop smoke both gave 1.178e-05).

### Aligned test setup + mojito bricks (2026-10-02, evening)

The three steps share `scripts/sobbh/_sobbh_testbox.py` with the EMRI / MBH setups: DAYS 180 360
720; the run box 0.25-25 mHz with EDGE_CROP_WAVELETS = 60 layers cropped per end; every SNR and
score against scirdv1 + the fitted tanh galactic foreground at the window's Tobs
(`FOREGROUND=off`: instrument only). `sobbh_speed_durations.sh` gained step 3,
`scripts/sobbh/sobbh_lookup_mojito.py` (MOJITO=auto): every SOBHB source with an L1 brick, the
catalogue row through the stock mapping, the brick's L1Orbits (ICRS), MOJITO_REFERENCE_TIME,
the window from brick start + 5e4 s; the lookup and the production template scored against the
brick (snr, data_snr, mm, logL, snr_ratio, snr_det, mm_vs_production). Laptop, bricks 0 and 1,
8-16 d with the foreground: production vs mojito mm 5e-12..2e-8, lookup vs production
1e-7..3.3e-6 (the harness without the edge crop had read ~0.1: the window edges).

Fixed on the way: the response coverage came from `orbits.t_base`, which for mojito L1Orbits
ends at REF + 449 d although the configured sc / ltt tables run to REF + 730.5 d (24-month
windows would have lost everything after day 449); it is now the configured span
(`SOBBHBatchedTOF.orbit_span`), and pixels outside the response coverage are a zero template on
both lookup paths (`SOBBHDirectWDM.covered_pixels`; `OrbitCoverageTest`).

### The table during a global-fit run (2026-10-02, the EMRI way)

`SOBBH_LOOKUP_TABLE_PATH` is now OPTIONAL. `resolve_sobbh_lookup_table(general_info, cfg)`
(`source_runtime.py`) returns `(path, status)`:

- set: that file (`"explicit"`; must exist; the comp getter then checks its LAYER duration
  against the run's, so any `(Nf, dt)` with the same `Nf * dt` serves, e.g. the laptop
  `NF180_DT20` table on the `NF1440_DT2p5` grid);
- unset: the canonical n_ref table of the run folder (`general_info.file_store_dir`),
  `wdm_lookup_store.lookup_table_path(None, file_store_dir, Nf, dt)` -- the EMRI recipe, so it
  is the SAME file `EMRI_LIKELIHOOD=direct` uses
  (`wdm_lookup_emri_cx_NF1440_DT2p5_TL32_fd8x0p01_nld2.h5` in production; Mike's cluster SOBBH
  table was built with exactly that recipe, only named differently) -- found there
  (`"found"`) or built and saved there first (`"built"`; one builder under `<path>.lock`, the
  other ranks `"waited"`), so a restart never rebuilds. Neither a path nor a run folder raises.

The 6-month launcher (`scripts/fstat_proposal/submit_gf_6mo_v9_4gpu.sh`) grew the matching
block after the EMRI one: `SOBBH_LIKELIHOOD` (default `chunked`), `SOBBH_LOOKUP_TABLE_PATH`
(default unset = the run folder's canonical file), `SOBBH_LOOKUP_EVAL_DT` (43200),
`SOBBH_LOOKUP_ROW_BATCH` (32), and a SOBBH PREFLIGHT that resolves the knobs through
`SourceSOBBHSettings` (an unknown env var is silently ignored), refuses a lisatools without
the lookup comp, refuses `GPUS_PER_RANK > 1`, and finds -- or builds and saves -- the table on
the submitting node's GPU before `mpiexec`, checking its layer duration. Launch:

    SOBBH_LIKELIHOOD=lookup NGPUS=4 ./scripts/fstat_proposal/submit_gf_6mo_v9_4gpu.sh

Tests: `tests/test_sobbh_lookup_stock.py::LookupTableResolutionTest` (found / built-and-saved
then found on restart / explicit wins / explicit must exist / explicit checked against the
layer duration, same-layer other sampling accepted); the store's own tests cover the lock,
the wait and the atomic build. The launcher preflight was dry-run on the laptop for the
explicit-table, chunked, `GPUS_PER_RANK=2` and missing-table cases.

Production settings from these runs: `SOBBH_LOOKUP_EVAL_DT=1800` (superseded by the 12-h
default above); `SOBBH_LOOKUP_ROW_BATCH` =
the move's row count when ~20 MB per row fits next to the other comps, else 96 (0.18 s per
batch; 288 rows in three batches ~0.55 s vs 0.39 in one).

### Pre-cluster CPU smoke (historical)

GPU results were not measurable on the laptop (no CUDA backend). The CPU smoke below
(`--backend cpu --laptop --nt 256 --rows 2,4 --repeats 1`) has
the lookup SLOWER than the chunked comp, and it must not be read as a GPU result: the smoke grid
is tiny (256 layers), so the lookup's fixed per-call template build (~4-7 s here, independent of
rows and of the grid: it was also ~7 s on the production grid) dominates; another session's Python
process was running during the original smoke, so the CPU numbers are contended (the Task 7 gate
measured 4.6 s per 8-row lookup call on a 1024-layer grid on the same laptop); and none of this
says anything about the GPU, where the per-row work is parallel. The CPU smoke scales with rows
(chunked 1.10 s at 2 rows, 2.19 s at 4), unlike the GPU expectation above. The cluster run is the
measurement.

CPU smoke, laptop preset:

    backend cpu  grid Nf=180 Nt=256 dt=20.0 layer_dt=3600 s  active 178 x 256  table wdm_lookup_emri_cx_NF180_DT20_TL32_fd8x0p01_nld2.h5  comp build 0.1 s
    chunked comp: Nt_sub=32 n_chunks=11 build 4.5 s
     rows  look_first  look_warm     resp     trac     look    inner  look_fill  ch_first   ch_warm   ch_fill  ch/look   max|dll|  lk_pool  ch_pool
        2       7.570      4.495    4.463    0.003    0.007    0.001      4.448     1.135     1.204     1.669     0.27  3.317e-05      nan      nan

(re-run after the span split: the lookup call's cost is the batched response build, `resp`; the
tracer and the lookup itself are milliseconds on this grid. The 4-row smoke row and the
production-grid table below predate the column rename: `tmpl` there is `resp + trac + look`.)

Production grid on CPU, 2 rows, lookup only (`--backend cpu --rows 2 --repeats 1 --no-chunked`;
completed, no watchdog exit; proves the Nf=1440, Nt=4320, dt=2.5 grid runs):

    backend cpu  grid Nf=1440 Nt=4320 dt=2.5 layer_dt=3600 s  active 179 x 4320  table wdm_lookup_emri_cx_NF180_DT20_TL32_fd8x0p01_nld2.h5  comp build 0.1 s
     rows  look_first  look_warm     tmpl    inner  look_fill  ch_first   ch_warm   ch_fill  ch/look   max|dll|  lk_pool  ch_pool
