# Launching the global fit (processes, ranks, GPUs)

*(2026-07: parallel-resources plan P0 established the process model below.
2026-09: the multi-rank walker-block port — one MPI rank per GPU, walker
blocks sharded across compute ranks — replaced the single-process
multi-GPU model as the default. Full architecture:
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-15-multirank-walker-blocks-design.md`](superpowers/specs/2026-09-15-multirank-walker-blocks-design.md).
Cluster validation runbook: [`docs/multirank-cluster-gates.md`](multirank-cluster-gates.md).)*

## The model

Each MPI rank owns a **walker block**: a fixed, equal-sized slice of the
ensemble's walkers, its own `AnalysisContainerArray` (one device, by
default), and — for every rank except the saver — a copy of the built recipe.
Fan-out lives inside the moves: a move's `propose` slices the full state into
per-rank blocks, ships each block to its rank, and merges the replies back
(`src/lisatools/globalfit/communication/`, `moves/walkerfanout.py`, the GB/VGB
three-command protocol in `moves/gbspecialstretch.py`). With exactly one
compute rank this collapses to a direct in-process call — no MPI traffic, no
pickling, bit-identical to the pre-port single-rank code
(`communication/ranks.py` module docstring; design spec Decision 9).

## Roles

- **HEAD** (rank 0 by default, i.e. `main_rank`): sequences the recipe via
  eryn's `run_mcmc`, owns the full host `GFState`, and **also computes**
  walker block 0 like any other compute rank.
- **COMPUTE**: owns a device list and one walker block; runs the
  `ComputeService` command loop (`comm.recv` is the clock; `{"op": "stop"}`
  exits). One rank per GPU by default.
- **SAVER**: the highest-numbered rank in the communicator, *only* at
  communicator size ≥ 3 (`resolve_roles`); writes HDF5 asynchronously, off
  the sampler's critical path. Below size 3 the saver role is aliased to the
  head — saves happen synchronously, exactly like a single-rank run.
- **SPARE**: exists only under `GF_LEGACY_RANK_LAYOUT=1` — builds like every
  other rank, then is sent `"stop"` at startup and exits without computing
  anything.

(`communication/ranks.py::resolve_roles`/`build_layout`; `run.py`'s
`role`/`RankRole` dispatch in `run_global_fit`.)

## The `np` matrix

`n_compute` is the number of COMPUTE ranks (HEAD included); it is what
`NWALKERS` must divide evenly. Two settings shape the rank↔GPU mapping:
`gpus_per_rank` (a rank owns several devices, sharded in-process by the
existing multi-GPU router) and `ranks_per_gpu` (several ranks share one
device); at most one of the two may exceed 1.

| `np` | Per-node GPU pool | Resulting layout |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | any | One rank: HEAD = SAVER = the only COMPUTE rank. AUTO `gpus_per_rank` resolves to the whole pool (today's single-process multi-GPU behavior, unchanged). |
| 2 | 1 GPU | Capacity fallback: rank 1 is demoted to dedicated SAVER with a `UserWarning` (`build_layout`'s `size == 2` branch); the head computes every walker, identical to `np=1`. |
| 2 | ≥2 GPUs, or 1 GPU with `RANKS_PER_GPU=2` | Two COMPUTE ranks (head + rank 1), **no dedicated saver** — the saver role is aliased to the head, so saves are synchronous. |
| 3 | 2 GPUs | Head + 1 COMPUTE rank + 1 dedicated SAVER (rank 2), one device each. |
| 3 | 1 GPU | **`ValueError`** from `build_layout`: 2 COMPUTE ranks on a 1-device pool over-subscribes it (`capacity = len(pool) * ranks_per_gpu // gpus_per_rank = 1`). No silent fallback above size 2 — set `RANKS_PER_GPU=2` to share the device deliberately. |
| 5 | 2 nodes × 2 GPUs | 4 COMPUTE ranks (one per GPU; AUTO `gpus_per_rank` resolves to 1 per node because more than one compute rank shares each node) + 1 dedicated SAVER. Launch with `srun --distribution=cyclic` so ranks land on both nodes. |

Only `np=2` gets a silent capacity fallback. At `np ≥ 3`, asking for more
COMPUTE ranks on a node than its GPU pool can host
(`len(pool) * ranks_per_gpu // gpus_per_rank`) is a hard `ValueError` from
`build_layout` — there is no silent fallback above size 2
(`ranks.py::build_layout`, the per-node `capacity` check under
`if pool and not legacy`). `NWALKERS % n_compute != 0` is likewise a hard
error, not a rounding fallback, when driven directly through `build_layout`
(the campaign submit script rounds `NWALKERS` up instead — see below).

## Knobs

| Knob | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `GPUS` | unset (CUDA sees whatever's visible) | The **per-node** device pool (`fit.general.gpus`) that `build_layout` partitions across the node's compute ranks. Not itself a rank count. |
| `GPUS_PER_RANK` | AUTO (`None`) | AUTO: a lone compute rank on a node owns the whole per-node pool (today's `-n 1` multi-GPU behavior, `gpus_per_rank = len(pool)`); with several compute ranks on a node AUTO instead gives each one device (`gpus_per_rank = 1`). An explicit int pins it on every node: that many devices per compute rank, sharded in-process by the existing multi-GPU router (`gpu_splits`/`BandView`). Supported by the layout but **not yet validated** at `> 1` with several ranks (see `docs/multigpu-cluster-validation.md`'s addendum). |
| `RANKS_PER_GPU` | 1 | That many compute ranks share each device, each with its own CUDA context and memory pool (`device_slot` distinguishes them on that device). |
| `NWALKERS` | variant default | Must be a multiple of `n_compute`; `build_layout` raises otherwise. Rank *r*'s block is `[r*B, (r+1)*B)` in compute-rank order, `B = NWALKERS / n_compute`. |
| `GF_LEGACY_RANK_LAYOUT` | `0` at the layout level (`ranks.py`'s own default); the campaign submit script keeps `1` at `NGPUS=2` until the WP7 gates pass (see below) | `1` restores today's pre-port roles: one compute rank owns the whole per-node pool, every other non-saver rank is a stopped SPARE. Rollback knob (design spec Risks). |
| `GF_LAYOUT_DRY_RUN` | unset | Preflight: every rank prints `layout.describe()` and the process exits **before** `fit.build()` allocates anything; a genuinely bad layout still raises inside `build_layout`/`prepare_rank` (Plan 5 Task 2 of this port — see `docs/multirank-cluster-gates.md`'s Step 0 for the exact invocation). |
| `GF_FANOUT_DIGEST` | unset | Emits a per-iteration `[FANOUT_DIGEST]` state-hash line (`log_like` + coords + inds), the cluster-gate tool for diffing two layouts for bit-identical transport (Plan 5 Task 4 of this port — see `docs/multirank-cluster-gates.md`'s Step 1). Emitted from the recipe's post-iteration hook regardless of the rank count, so the single-rank baseline prints it too. |

## Every rank builds

`prepare_rank(fit, comm)` runs **before** `fit.build()` in both drivers
(`scripts/run_global.py`, `scripts/fstat_proposal/run_combined_staged.py`):
it resolves the layout, pins `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` (or falls back to
`cudaSetDevice`) on this rank, and writes `fit.rank_layout` /
`fit.general.gpus` (narrowed to this rank's device list) before any CUDA
call. Every rank then calls `fit.build()` — HEAD, COMPUTE, SAVER, and (under
the legacy layout) SPARE all construct the full data pipeline; only the
walker-block *size* of each rank's `AnalysisContainerArray` differs (design
spec Decision 4). There is no "spare that never builds" any more except
under `GF_LEGACY_RANK_LAYOUT=1`, and even the legacy spare builds, then
releases its device memory and waits for the startup `"stop"`.

## Per-rank log files and stdout prefixes

The head keeps today's log file names: `globalfit_run.log` /
`global_fit.log`. Every other rank gets `globalfit_run.rank<k>.log` /
`global_fit.rank<k>.log` (`run.py::_rank_log_filenames`).

Stdout tag format (`communication/ranks.py::rank_tag`): `r<k>/head` (HEAD),
`r<k>/c<i>` (COMPUTE, `i` = the rank's 0-based position among compute
ranks — usually equal to its world rank), `r<k>/saver` (SAVER), `r<k>/spare`
(legacy SPARE). Only **non-head** ranks actually get their stdout lines
wrapped in `[tag] ` (`run.py`: `if self.rank != self.main_rank:
prefix_stdout(rank_tag(...))`) — the head's own console output is never
prefixed, though its tag still appears inside its own log text. A log/stdout
grep for a specific rank's output should match `^\[r<k>/`.

## Commands

```sh
# single process (laptop / driver-script development)
python scripts/run_global.py --stock <name>

# one rank per GPU on a 2-GPU node: head + 1 compute + 1 saver
GPUS=0,1 mpiexec -n 3 python scripts/run_global.py --stock <name>

# two compute ranks sharing one GPU (no second device required)
GPUS=0 RANKS_PER_GPU=2 mpiexec -n 3 python scripts/run_global.py --stock <name>

# 2 nodes x 2 GPUs -> 4 compute ranks + 1 saver
srun -N 2 --gres=gpu:2 --ntasks=5 --distribution=cyclic \
  python scripts/run_global.py --stock <name>

# preflight only: print the layout on every rank, build nothing
GF_LAYOUT_DRY_RUN=1 mpiexec -n 3 python scripts/run_global.py --stock <name>
```

A python driver is equivalent — rank logic lives in `GlobalFit`, not the CLI:

```python
from lisatools.globalfit.stock import erebor
from lisatools.globalfit.communication.ranks import prepare_rank
from mpi4py import MPI

fit = erebor.all_sources(nwalkers=36)
prepare_rank(fit, MPI.COMM_WORLD)   # BEFORE build(): resolves layout, pins the device
fit.build()
fit.run()          # every rank in the communicator takes its role
```

Common env knobs: `NWALKERS`, `NTEMPS`, `NUM_ITERATIONS`, `DATA_MODE`
(`mojito`/`synthetic`), `TOBS_TARGET`, `MAKE_DIAGNOSTIC_PLOTS`, `GPUS`,
`GPUS_PER_RANK`, `RANKS_PER_GPU`, `USE_GPU`, `GPU_BACKEND`, `VERBOSE`,
`GF_LEGACY_RANK_LAYOUT`.

**Console output is quiet by default.** Everything is still logged to the
run's log files (`…_artifacts/global_fit.log`, `globalfit_run.log`,
`general_setup.log`, and their per-rank counterparts above); only
warnings/errors reach the console. Set `verbose=True` at construction
(`erebor.<variant>(verbose=True)`, a headline knob — or `VERBOSE=1`) to
stream the logs to stdout and turn the progress bars back on.

**Threading policy (2026-07): MPI-only — no OMP.** `run_global.py` pins
`OMP_NUM_THREADS` / `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` / `MKL_NUM_THREADS` /
`VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS` / `NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS` to 1 before any import
(OMP-threaded kernels have caused OOM kills on dev machines). Parallelism
comes from MPI ranks and, when configured, GPUs. Set the env vars
explicitly to override; python drivers that bypass `run_global.py` should
pin them the same way before importing numpy/lisatools.

## Campaign submit scripts: the NGPUS dispatch

`scripts/fstat_proposal/submit_gf_6mo_v8.sh` (and its `_nogb`/`_nogb_null`
siblings) resolve the rank count from a GPU-count knob rather than a fixed
`--ntasks`. Run the script **directly** (not via a bare `sbatch`) so its
self-dispatch block can pick the partition/node/task-count and resubmit
itself:

```sh
NGPUS=2 ./submit_gf_6mo_v8.sh      # gpu-80-spot, 1 node x gpu:2 (default)
NGPUS=4 ./submit_gf_6mo_v8.sh      # gpu-80-spot, 2 nodes x gpu:2 each
sbatch  ./submit_gf_6mo_v8.sh      # legacy flow: static header defaults
                                    #   (2 GPUs, gpu-80-spot, --ntasks=3)
```

- `NGPUS=2`: `gpu-80-spot`, 1 node, `--gres=gpu:2`. `GF_LEGACY_RANK_LAYOUT`
  defaults to `1` — the campaign stays on today's roles (one compute rank
  drives both GPUs, rank 1 a stopped spare, rank 2 the saver;
  `mpiexec -n 3`) until the WP7 cluster gates pass, byte-identical in effect
  to the pre-port launch.
- `NGPUS=4`: `gpu-80-spot`, **2 nodes** × `--gres=gpu:2`,
  `--distribution=cyclic` — the cluster's real 4-GPU shape (there is no
  single 4-GPU node). `GF_LEGACY_RANK_LAYOUT` is **forced to `0`**
  regardless of any pre-set value, because the legacy layout cannot span
  nodes.
- `N_COMPUTE = NGPUS * RANKS_PER_GPU / GPUS_PER_RANK` (`GPUS_PER_RANK` empty
  counts as 1 for this arithmetic — AUTO resolution itself happens inside
  `build_layout`); the self-resubmission passes `--ntasks=$((N_COMPUTE+1))`
  explicitly (the saver) — the static `#SBATCH --ntasks=3` header line is
  only the legacy/manual-`sbatch` fallback.
- In-job, `_NGPUS_EFF` follows `SLURM_GPUS_ON_NODE` (the granted truth, not
  the pre-submit `NGPUS` intent) and `N_COMPUTE_EFF` is recomputed the same
  way, pinned to `1` under `GF_LEGACY_RANK_LAYOUT=1`.
- `NWALKERS % N_COMPUTE_EFF`: when non-legacy and the check fails, the
  script **rounds `NWALKERS` up** to the next multiple and prints a loud
  `[SUBMIT]` line rather than failing — `build_layout` itself would raise.
  Its default `NWALKERS=10` is not divisible by `N_COMPUTE=4` at `NGPUS=4`,
  so a first 4-GPU launch rounds to 12 unless `NWALKERS` is set explicitly.
- Launch line: `srun --ntasks=$SLURM_NTASKS --distribution=cyclic ...` when
  `SLURM_NNODES > 1`, else `mpiexec -n ${SLURM_NTASKS:-3} ...`.
- Under the walker-block (non-legacy) layout, `np=3` on a 2-GPU pool puts a
  real compute rank on each GPU; under the legacy layout rank 1 was a
  stopped spare that occupied a device without using it.
- In-job, a `SLURM_NNODES > 1` allocation **forces** `GF_LEGACY_RANK_LAYOUT=0`
  with a loud `[SUBMIT]` line (same rule as `NGPUS=4`, applied to the granted
  allocation rather than the pre-submit intent): the legacy layout's single
  compute rank is per-node, so a manual `sbatch --nodes=2 --ntasks=5` under it
  would leave node B's ranks idle.

## Semantics that change only when several compute ranks exist

These are accepted, intentional differences from single-rank behavior — see
the design spec's "Semantics that change only when `n_compute > 1`" and the
Plan 3/4 fan-out mixins' module docstrings for the code-level detail.

- **Ladder adaptation is pooled, once per propose.** Eryn ladders (addremove
  MBH/EMRI/SOBBH, PSD/galfor/sgwb) adapt ONCE per propose from the pooled
  swap ratio (sum accepted / sum proposed over ranks and repeats); `tc.time`
  advances once per propose instead of once per repeat. Ranks never adapt
  their own copy — only the head does, after merging
  (`moves/walkerfanout.py` module docstring; `pooled_ladder_step`). GB's
  `band_temps` cadence is unchanged (it already adapted once per propose),
  but the swap counters it adapts from are now summed across ranks by the
  head orchestrator before the one `_adapt_band_temps` call (design spec
  line 234; WP5 Architecture, fan-out 2 merge step).
- **Mid-iteration checkpoint granularity** for the addremove family drops
  from per-leaf to per-propose (the per-leaf `midit_checkpoint.maybe_write`
  is guarded off inside a rank body and moved to the head's merge step).
- **Eigen, info-matrix and F-stat reference tables are rank-local
  proposal-shaped tables** (still valid MH); the eigen sidecar is written by
  the head only. `GB_INFOMAT_PER_BLOCK=1` (`infomat_per_block`) retires the
  old cross-device info-matrix borrow. GB's frequency-window friend table
  (`BandSorter.build_friend_table`) is likewise rank-local, built from the
  rank's own walker block only.
- **Stretch complements are the rank's local block.** PSD `RedBlue` splits,
  the optional VGB `stretch` kind, and `MBH_INNER_MOVE_KIND=stretch` all draw
  their complement from the local block, not the full ensemble — stretch
  proposals were explicitly ruled out of scope for this port (design spec
  Decision 7).
- **PSD search-mode termination is per block.** `PSDMove.run_move_max_likelihood`
  plateaus on the RANK's walker-block maximum, not a pooled maximum across
  ranks (pooling it would need an in-body collective; deferred).
- **The PSD ladder's swap population differs by mode.** The pooled
  adaptation consumes `PSDMove.run_move`'s explicit `temperature_swaps`
  tallies (fancy swaps included); single-rank mode instead adapts from
  eryn `RedBlueMove.propose`'s identity `temper_comps` swaps. Both are valid
  acceptance ratios; the swap population feeding the ladder differs between
  the two modes.
- **`move.temperature_control.swaps_accepted`** — what eryn stores to the
  HDF backend — is the HEAD block's count only; the pooled/summed counters
  that actually drive adaptation live in the sub-state. Diagnostic-only
  field; nothing reads the HDF-stored copy back.
- **No cross-rank tempering swaps in the base port.** GB/VGB in-band cell
  tempering (`run_tempering`) stays strictly within a rank — the swap unit
  is device-resident slab state and cross-rank exchange was assessed as very
  hard (design spec, "Cross-rank swaps: assessment"); `[GB_TEMPER_CHECK ...]`
  is logged per rank, each rank checking only its own census/device accept
  counters. Cross-rank fancy swaps for the *non*-GB, non-VGB moves (MBH,
  EMRI, SOBBH, PSD/galfor/sgwb) are WP8's scope (`cross_rank_swaps`, default
  off) — GB and VGB keep a `# TODO(multi-rank)` marker either way.
- **No end-of-run submission dump under several compute ranks.**
  `GlobalFit._write_submission` returns early with a `logger.warning` when
  `not layout.is_single()`: the head's ACA holds only its own walker block,
  so the residual dump would be wrong over the full ensemble. An explicit
  `TODO(multi-rank)` marks the gap in the warning text itself; routing the
  submission writer through the fan-out is unscoped follow-up work.
- **A neutral GB block's `log_like` is not rebuilt from the residual.** When
  the head marks a walker block *neutral* (an alive-only move — one carrying
  `use_prior_removal` or `rj_replace` — over a block with no alive source),
  that rank runs nothing and replies with zeros, and the head SKIPS the merge
  for it: those walkers keep the `log_like` they came in with rather than
  having it re-derived. Same as the legacy behaviour for a zero-source
  ensemble, and every other branch's move still rebuilds the same walkers'
  likelihood, so nothing goes stale in a real recipe — but the zeros in a
  neutral reply are "nothing happened", never state
  (`GBSpecialBase._gb_neutral_finish_reply`).
- **Per-rank accept-split log lines.** `[GB_ACCEPT rj-split ...]` (and the
  analogous replace-split line) is now printed once per compute rank, into
  that rank's own log file — a monitor/digest tool that only reads the
  head's `globalfit_run.log` sees just the head block's births, not the
  whole ensemble's.

## Debug-plot instrumentation (per-move residual tracing)

The GB special-stretch move and the source moves
(``ResidualAddOneRemoveOneMove`` — MBH phentax / EMRI / SOBBH) can dump
per-step figures tracing the "remove source from the residual → sample →
put it back" choreography. Output is a GB-style flip-book: one figure per
moment (source in fit → isolated → refit), each rows = TDI channels (X/Y/Z),
columns = [total template | total data | residual]. The template/data columns
are fixed references and the residual column changes across frames, so
flipping ``_f0`` / ``_f1`` / ``_f2`` animates the source leaving and
re-entering the residual.

Two ways to turn it on (precedence: move-spec > stage-spec > env):

**Env, per branch** — the source moves self-activate from
``{BRANCH}_DEBUG`` (capitalised branch name):

```sh
EMRI_DEBUG=1  SOBBH_DEBUG=1  MBH_DEBUG=1  \
EMRI_DEBUG_DIR=./emri_dbg  MBH_DEBUG_PLOT_WALKER=2  MBH_DEBUG_EVERY=10 \
python scripts/run_global.py --stock all_sources
```
Companion knobs (each prefixed by the branch): ``{B}_DEBUG_DIR``,
``{B}_DEBUG_PLOT_WALKER``, ``{B}_DEBUG_PLOT_LEAF``, ``{B}_DEBUG_EVERY``. GB
uses the analogous ``GB_DEBUG`` / ``GB_DEBUG_DIR`` /
``GB_DEBUG_PLOT_WALKER`` / ``GB_DEBUG_PLOT_BAND``.

**Move / stage level, in code** — via the recipe API (works for GB and the
source moves uniformly, and is picklable):

```python
fit = erebor.all_sources()
fit.set_move_debug("emri_pe", plot_dir="./emri_dbg", every=5)  # one move
fit.set_stage_debug("full_pe", plot_walker=2)                  # whole stage
fit.set_move_debug("psd_pe", False)                            # force off
```
These set ``Move.debug`` / ``Stage.debug``, applied at
materialization through ``GlobalFitMove.set_debug(...)`` (options:
``plot_dir``, ``plot_walker``, ``plot_leaf`` / ``plot_band``, ``every``).

## Notes

- `head_rank` is a retired legacy alias (old multi-stage pipeline); it
  defaults to the main rank and has no role. The saver rank is assigned
  automatically — there is no knob for it.
- The saver currently writes gzip-9 HDF5 and does not yet plot; moving the
  diagnostic plot set onto it (with saves-take-priority backpressure) is
  plan phase P2.
- `GlobalFit.resolve_rank_roles` is kept as a legacy-compat wrapper for old
  callers of the `(main_rank, results_rank, spare_ranks)` shape; its
  `spare_ranks` return is always `[]`, including under the legacy layout —
  use `layout.role_of(rank)` / `layout.compute_ranks` for anything new.
